    "\\nExample 1:\n",
    "Query: What are the key performance specifications of the Cessna 172S, and how do they impact flight planning?\n",
    "Answer: The key performance specifications of the Cessna 172S include a maximum speed of 126 knots at sea level, a service ceiling of 14,000 feet, and a rate of climb of 730 feet per minute at sea level. These specifications impact flight planning by determining the range, endurance, and optimal cruising altitude for flights. For instance, the aircraft's range is approximately 518 nautical miles at 75% power, making it suitable for medium-range flights without refueling.\n",
    "\\nExample 2:\n",
    "Query: How does the Cessna 172S fuel system operate, and what are the critical safety considerations?\n",
    "Answer: The Cessna 172S fuel system includes two tanks, one in each wing, with a total capacity of 56 gallons, of which 53 gallons are usable. The system is gravity-fed and includes a selector valve that allows the pilot to draw fuel from either tank or both tanks simultaneously. Critical safety considerations include ensuring the fuel selector is in the \"BOTH\" position during takeoff and landing, monitoring fuel levels carefully, and avoiding prolonged uncoordinated flight when fuel is low, as this could cause engine starvation.\n",
    "\\nExample 3:\n",
    "Query: What are the emergency procedures for an engine failure in a Cessna 172S?\n",
    "Answer: In the event of an engine failure in a Cessna 172S, the pilot should first establish the best glide speed of 68 knots. Then, identify a suitable landing site and prepare for a forced landing. Attempt to restart the engine by switching fuel tanks, setting the mixture to rich, and engaging the starter. If the restart fails, turn off the fuel, master switch, and magnetos, and prepare for landing with flaps as required. The POH outlines these steps in detail under emergency procedures.\n",
    "\\nExample 4:\n",
    "Query: What is the maneuvering speed (VA) of the Cessna 172S, and why is it important?\n",
    "Answer: The maneuvering speed (VA) of the Cessna 172S varies with weight but is typically around 105 knots at maximum gross weight. This speed is important because it represents the maximum speed at which the aircraft can be flown with full, abrupt control inputs without exceeding its structural limits. Flying at or below VA protects the aircraft from structural damage during turbulence or aggressive maneuvers.\n",

The left fuel tank is vented overboard through a vent line, equipped with a check valve, which protrudes from the bottom surface of the left wing near the wing strut.  Both fuel filler caps are also vented. REDUCED TANK CAPACITY The airplane may be serviced to a reduced capacity to permit heavier cabin loadings.  This is accomplished by filling each tank to the bottom edge of the fuel filler tab, thus giving a reduced fuel load of 17.5 gallons usable in each tank. FUEL SELECTOR VALVE The fuel selector valve should be in the BOTH position for takeoff, climb, landing, and maneuvers that involve prolonged slips or skids of more than 30 seconds.  Operation from either LEFT or RIGHT tank is reserved for cruising flight. 7-26 NOTE When the fuel selector valve handle is in the BOTH position in cruising flight, unequal fuel flow from each tank may occur if the wings are not maintained exactly level.\n",
