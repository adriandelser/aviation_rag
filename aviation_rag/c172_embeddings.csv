Limits Standard Empty Weight Basic Empty Weight Useful Load MAC July 8/98 Reference Datum is an imaginary vertical plane from which all horizontal distances are measured for balance purposes. Station is a location along the airplane fuselage given in terms of the distance from the reference datum. Arm is the horizontal distance from the reference datum to the center of gravity (C.  G.) of an item. Moment is the product of the weight of an item multiplied by its arm. (Moment divided by the constant 1000 is used in this handbook to simplify balance calculations by reducing the number of digits.) Center of Gravity is the point at which an airplane, or equipment, would balance if suspended.  Its distance from the reference datum is found by dividing the total moment by the total weight of the airplane. Center of Gravity Arm is the arm obtained by adding the airplane's individual moments and dividing the sum by the total weight. Center of Gravity Limits are the extreme center of gravity locations within which the airplane must be operated at a given weight. Standard Empty Weight is the weight of a standard airplane, including unusable fuel, full operating fluids and full engine oil.",335.75
-23,Basic Empty Weight is the standard empty weight plus the weight of optional equipment. Useful Load is the difference between ramp weight and the basic empty weight.

3,"Aerobatics that may impose high loads should not be attempted. The important thing to bear in mind in flight maneuvers is that the airplane is clean in aerodynamic design and will build up speed quickly with the nose down.  Proper speed control is an essential re- quirement for execution of any maneuver, and care should always be exercised to avoid excessive speed which in turn can impose ex- cessive loads.  In the execution of all maneuvers, avoid abrupt use of controls. Jul 8/98 2-9",122.25

23,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 3 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES AMPLIFIED EMERGENCY PROCEDURES The following Amplified Emergency Procedures elaborate upon information contained in the Emergency Procedures Checklists portion of this section.  These procedures also include information not readily adaptable to a checklist format, and material to which a pilot could not be expected to refer in resolution of a specific emergency.  This information should be reviewed in detail prior to flying the airplane, as well as reviewed on a regular basis to keep pilot's knowledge of procedures fresh. ENGINE FAILURE If an engine failure occurs during the takeoff roll, the most important thing to do is stop the airplane on the remaining runway. Those extra items on the checklist will provide added safety after a failure of this type. Prompt lowering of the nose to maintain airspeed and establish a glide attitude is the first response to an engine failure after takeoff. In most cases, the landing should be planned straight ahead with only small changes in direction to avoid obstructions.  Altitude and airspeed are seldom sufficient to execute a 180° gliding turn necessary to return to the runway.  The checklist procedures assume that adequate time exists to secure the fuel and ignition systems prior to touchdown. July 8/98 3-13",328.75
24,"SECTION 3 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES CESSNA MODEL 172S After an engine failure in flight, the most important course of l action is to continue flying the airplane.  Best glide speed as shown in Figure 3-1 should be established as quickly as possible.  While gliding toward a suitable landing area, an effort should be made to identify the cause of the failure.  If time permits, an engine restart should be attempted as shown in the checklist.  If the engine cannot be restarted, a forced landing without power must be completed. 12,000 I- 10,000 LL z <( 8000 a: a: LlJ I- LlJ 6000 > 0 en <( I- 4000 I CD LlJ I 2000 *SPEED 68 KIAS * PROPELLER WINDMILLING *FLAPS UP *ZERO WIND 0 0 2 4 6 8 1 0 12 14 16 18 20 GROUND DISTANCE - NAUTICAL MILES 0585C1011 Figure 3-1.

25,"CESSNA MODEL 172S FORCED LANDINGS SECTION 3 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES If all attempts to restart the engine fail and a forced landing is imminent, select a suitable field and prepare for the landing as discussed under the Emergency Landing Without Engine Power checklist.  Transmit Mayday message on 121.5 MHz giving location and intentions and squawk 7700. Before attempting an ""off airport"" landing with engine power available, one should fly over the landing area at a safe but low altitude to inspect the terrain for obstructions and surface conditions, proceeding as discussed under the Precautionary Landing With Engine Power checklist. Prepare for ditching by securing or jettisoning heavy objects located in the baggage area and collect folded coats for protection of occupants' face at touchdown.  Transmit Mayday message on 121 .5 MHz giving location and intentions and squawk 7700.  Avoid a landing flare because of difficulty in judging height over a water surface.  The checklist assumes the availability of power to make a precautionary water landing.  If power is not available, use of the airspeeds noted with minimum flap extension will provide a more favorable attitude for a power off ditching. In a forced landing situation, do not set the AVIONICS MASTERI switch or the airplane MASTER switch to the OFF position until a landing is assured.  When these switches are in the OFF position, the airplane electrical systems are de-energized.",363.0
25,"Before performing a forced landing, especially in remote and mountainous areas, activate the EL T transmitter by positioning the cockpit-mounted switch to the ON position. For complete information on EL T operation, refer to the Supplements, Section 9. LANDING WITHOUT ELEVATOR CONTROL Trim for horizontal flight (with an airspeed of approximately 65 KIAS and flaps set to 20°) by using throttle and elevator trim controls.  Then do not change the elevator trim control setting;I control the glide angle by adjusting power exclusively. Revision 4 3-15",137.75
26,"SECTION 3 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES CESSNA MODEL 172S I At the landing flare (round-out), the nose down moment resulting from power reduction is an adverse factor and the airplane may land on the nose wheel.  Consequently, at flare, the elevator trim control should be adjusted toward the full nose up position and the power adjusted so that the airplane will rotate to the horizontal attitude for touchdown.  Close the throttle at touchdown. FIRES Although engine fires are extremely rare in flight, the steps of the appropriate checklist should be followed if one is encountered.  After completion of this procedure, execute a forced landing.  Do not attempt to restart the engine. The initial indication of an electrical fire is usually the odor of burning insulation.  The checklist for this problem should result in elimination of the fire. EMERGENCY OPERATION IN CLOUDS (Total Vacuum System Failure) If both the vacuum pumps fail in flight, the directional indicator and attitude indicator will be disabled, and the pilot will have to rely on the turn coordinator if he inadvertently flies into clouds.  If an autopilot is installed, it too may be affected.",289.5
26,"Refer to Section 9, Supplements, for additional details concerning autopilot operation. The following instructions assume that only the electrically powered turn coordinator is operative, and that the pilot is not completely proficient in instrument flying. EXECUTING A 180° TURN IN CLOUDS Upon inadvertently entering the clouds, an immediate plan should be made to turn back as follows: 1.  Note the compass heading. 2.  Using the clock, initiate a standard rate left turn, holding the turn coordinator symbolic airplane wing opposite the lower left index mark for 60 seconds.  Then roll back to level flight by leveling the miniature airplane. 3-16 Revision 4",165.25
27,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 3 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES 3.  Check accuracy of the turn by observing the compass heading which should be the reciprocal of the original heading. 4.  If necessary, adjust heading primarily with skidding motions rather than rolling motions so that the compass will read more accurately. 5.  Maintain altitude and airspeed by cautious application of elevator control.  Avoid over controlling by keeping the hands off the control wheel as much as possible and steering only with rudder. EMERGENCY DESCENT THROUGH CLOUDS If conditions prevent return to VFR flight by a 180° turn, al descent through a cloud deck to VFR conditions may be appropriate.  If possible, obtain radio clearance for an emergency descent through clouds.  To guard against a spiral dive, choose an easterly or westerly heading to minimize compass card swings due to changing bank angles.",219.75
27,"In addition, keep hands off the control wheel and steer a straight course with rudder control by monitoring the turn coordinator.  Occasionally check the compass heading and make minor corrections to hold an approximate course.  Before descending into the clouds, set up a stabilized letdown condition as follows: 1.  Apply full rich mixture. 2.  Reduce power to set up a 500 to 800 ft/min rate of descent. 3.  Adjust the elevator trim for a stabilized descent at 70-80 KIAS. 4.  Keep hands off the control wheel.",128.25
27,"5.  Monitor turn coordinator and make corrections by rudder alone. 6.  Check trend of compass card movement and make cautious corrections with rudder to stop the turn. 7.  Upon breaking out of clouds, resume normal cruising flight. Revision 4 3-17",61.75
28,"SECTION 3 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES RECOVERY FROM SPIRAL DIVE IN THE CLOUDS CESSNA MODEL 172S If a spiral is encountered in the clouds, proceed as follows: 1.  Retard throttle to idle position. 2.  Stop the turn by using coordinated aileron and rudder control to align the symbolic airplane in the turn coordinator with the horizon reference line. 3.  Cautiously apply elevator back pressure to slowly reduce the airspeed to 80 KIAS. 4.  Adjust the elevator trim control to maintain an 80 KIAS glide. 5.  Keep hands off the control wheel, using rudder control to hold a straight heading.",145.5
28,"6.  Clear engine occasionally, but avoid using enough power to disturb the trimmed glide. 7.  Upon breaking out of clouds, resume normal cruising flight. INADVERTENT FLIGHT INTO ICING CONDITIONS I Flight into icing conditions is prohibited and extremely dangerous.  An inadvertent encounter with these conditions can best be handled using the checklist procedures.  The best procedure, of course, is to turn back or change altitude to escape icing conditions. During these encounters, an unexplained loss in engine speed could be caused by ice blocking the air intake filter, or, in extremely rare instances, ice completely blocking the fuel injection air reference tubes.  In either case, the throttle should be positioned to obtain maximum RPM (in some instances, the throttle may need to be retarded for maximum power).  The mixture should then be adjusted, as required, to obtain maximum RPM.",224.0
28,"STATIC SOURCE BLOCKED If erroneous readings of the static source instruments (airspeed, altimeter and vertical speed) are suspected, the static pressure lalternate source valve should be pulled ON, thereby supplying static pressure to these instruments from the cabin. 3-18 Revision 4",71.0
29,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 3 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES I When using the alternate static source, refer to the Alternate Static Source Airspeed Calibration table in Section 5, Performance, for additional information.

30,"SECTION 3 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES ROUGH ENGINE OPERATION OR LOSS OF POWER SPARK PLUG FOULING CESSNA MODEL 172S A slight engine roughness in flight may be caused by one or more spark plugs becoming fouled by carbon or lead deposits.  This may be verified by turning the ignition switch momentarily from BOTH to either L or R position.  An obvious power loss in single ignition operation is evidence of spark plug or magneto trouble. Assuming that spark plugs are the more likely cause, lean the mixture to the recommended lean setting for cruising flight.  If the problem does not clear up in several minutes, determine if a richer mixture setting will produce smoother operation.  If not, proceed to the nearest airport for repairs using the BOTH position of the ignition switch unless extreme roughness dictates the use of a single ignition position. MAGNETO MALFUNCTION A sudden engine roughness or misfiring is usually evidence of magneto problems.  Switching from BOTH to either L or R ignition switch position will identify which magneto is malfunctioning.  Select different power settings and enrichen the mixture to determine if lcontinued operation on BOTH magnetos is possible.  If not, switch to the good magneto and proceed to the nearest airport for repairs.",316.75
30,"ENGINE-DRIVEN FUEL PUMP FAILURE Failure of the engine-driven fuel pump will result in an immediate loss of engine power, similar to fuel exhaustion or starvation, but while operating from a fuel tank containing adequate fuel.  A sudden reduction in indicated fuel flow will occur just before loss of engine power. If the engine-driven fuel pump fails, immediately set the auxiliary fuel pump switch (FUEL PUMP) to the ON position to restore engine power.  The flight should be terminated as soon as practical and the engine-driven fuel pump repaired. 3-20 Revision 4",141.5
31,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 3 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES EXCESSIVE FUEL VAPOR INDICATIONS Excessive fuel vapor is most likely to be generated during groun operations when operating at higher altitudes, in unusually warm temperatures or with more volatile fuel blends.  Operation at or nea idle RPM (low fuel flow) for extended periods will increase th chances of fuel vapor generation. (See ""Leaning For Groun Operations"", Section 4.) Indicated fuel flow that is not stable (sudden changes greate than 1 gal/hr) is a sign that fuel vapor may be present in the system. Fuel flow indications that become less stable (increasing changes) may lead to power surges and power loss if not corrected. If in-flight vapor is suspected, smoother engine operation ma result from making the following changes (singly or together): se the auxiliary fuel pump to the ON position, lean the mixture fo smooth engine operation and select another fuel tank. Increasing the airspeed to provide more air flow through the cowling will aid in cooling the engine and fuel system components. LOW OIL PRESSURE If the low oil pressure annunciator (OIL PRESS) illuminates and oil temperature remains normal, the oil pressure sending unit o~ relief valve may be malfunctioning.  Land at the nearest airport t inspect the source of trouble. If a total loss of oil pressure is accompanied by a rise in oil temperature, there is good reason to suspect an engine failure is imminent.",360.5
31,Reduce engine power immediately and select a suitable forced landing field.  Use only the minimum power required to reach the desired touchdown spot. Revision 4 3-21 I,41.75
32,"SECTION 3 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES ELECTRICAL POWER SUPPLY SYSTEM MALFUNCTIONS CESSNA MODEL 172S Malfunctions in the electrical power supply system can be detected by periodic monitoring of the ammeter and low voltage lannunciator (VOL TS); however, the cause of these malfunctions is usually difficult to determine.  A broken alternator drive belt or wiring is most likely the cause of alternator failures, although other factors could cause the problem.  A defective alternator control unit can also cause malfunctions.  Problems of this nature constitute an electrical emergency and should be dealt with immediately.  Electrical power malfunctions usually fall into two categories: excessive rate of charge and insufficient rate of charge.  The following paragraphs describe the recommended remedy for each situation. EXCESSIVE RATE OF CHARGE After engine starting and heavy electrical usage at low engine speeds (such as extended taxiing) the battery condition will be low enough to accept above normal charging during the initial part of a flight.  However, after thirty minutes of cruising flight, the ammeter should be indicating less than two needle widths of charging current.  If the charging rate were to remain above this value on a long flight, the battery would overheat and evaporate the electrolyte at an excessive rate. Electronic components in the electrical system can be adversely affected by higher than normal voltage.",359.0
32,"The alternator control unit includes an overvoltage sensor which normally will automatically shut down the alternator if the charge voltage reaches approximately 31.5 volts.  If the overvoltage sensor malfunctions, as evidenced by an excessive rate of charge shown on the ammeter, the alternator should be turned off, nonessential electrical equipment turned off and the flight terminated as soon as practical. Revision 4",105.25
33,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 3 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES INSUFFICIENT RATE OF CHARGE NOTE The low voltage annunciator (VOL TS) may come on and ammeter discharge indications may occur during low RPM conditions with an electrical load on the system, such as during a low RPM taxi.  Under these conditions, the annunciator will go out at higher RPM. I I If the overvoltage sensor should shut down the alternator and trip the alternator circuit breaker (ALT FLO), or if the alternator output isl low, a discharge rate will be shown on the ammeter followed by illumination of the low voltage annunciator (VOL TS).  Since this maYI be a ""nuisance"" trip out, an attempt should be made to reactivate the alternator system.  To reactivate, set the avionics master switch to the OFF position, check that the alternator circuit breaker (AL FLO) is in, then set both sides of the master switch to the OF position and then to the ON position.  If the problem no longer exists, normal alternator charging will resume and the low voltag annunciator (VOL TS) will go off.  The avionics master switch ma then be returned to the ON position. If the annunciator illuminates again, a malfunction is confirmed.  I In this event, the flight should be terminated and/or the current drain on the battery minimized because the battery can supply the electrical system for only a limited period of time.  Battery power must be conserved for later operation of the wing flaps and, if the emergency occurs at night, for possible use of the landing lights during landing.",383.5
33,"OTHER EMERGENCIES WINDSHIELD DAMAGE If a bird strike or other incident should damage the windshield in flight to the point of creating an opening, a significant loss in performance may be expected.  This loss may be minimized in some cases (depending on amount of damage, altitude, etc.)by opening the side windows while the airplane is maneuvered for a landing at the nearest airport.  If airplane performance or other adverse conditions preclude landing at an airport, prepare for an ""off airport"" landing in accordance with the Precautionary Landing With Engine Power or Ditching checklists.

Airplane should be parked in a normal ground attitude (refer to Figure 1-1) to ensure that fuel drain valves allow for accurate sampling.  Use of the refueling steps and assist handles will simplify access to the upper wing surfaces for visual checks and refueling operations. In cold weather, remove even small accumulations of frost, ice or snow from wing, tail and control surfaces.  Also, make sure that control surfaces contain no internal accumulations of ice or debris.  Prior to flight, check that pitot heater is warm to touch within 30 seconds with battery and pitot heat switches on.

52,"SECTION 4 NORMAL PROCEDURES AMPLIFIED PROCEDURES PREFLIGHT INSPECTION CESSNA MODEL 172S The Preflight Inspection, described in Figure 4-1 and adjacent checklist, is required prior to each flight.  If the airplane has been in extended storage, has had recent major maintenance, or has been operated from marginal airports, a more extensive exterior inspection is recommended. After major maintenance has been performed, the flight and trim tab controls should be double checked for free and correct movement and security.  The security of all inspection plates on the airplane should be checked following periodic inspections.  If the airplane has been waxed or polished, check the external static pressure source hole for stoppage. If the airplane has been exposed to much ground handling in a crowded hangar, it should be checked for dents and scratches on lwings, fuselage, and tail surfaces, damage to navigation and anti- collision lights, damage to nose wheel as a result of exceeding tow limits, and avionics antennas. Outside storage for long periods may result in dust and dirt accumulation on the induction air filter, obstructions in airspeed system lines, water contaminants in fuel tanks and insect/bird/rodent nests in any opening.  If any water is detected in the fuel system, the fuel tank sump quick drain valves, fuel reservoir quick drain valve, and fuel strainer quick drain valve should all be thoroughly drained again.  Then, the wings should be gently rocked and the tail lowered to the ground to move any further contaminants to the sampling points.  Repeated samples should then be taken at all quick drain points until all contamination has been removed.",419.75
52,"If, after repeated sampling, evidence of contamination still exists, the fuel tanks should be completely drained and the fuel system cleaned. Additionally, if the airplane has been stored outside in windy or gusty areas, or tied down adjacent to taxiing airplanes, special attention should be paid to control surface stops, hinges, and brackets to detect the presence of potential wind damage. 4-18 May 30/00",102.0
53,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 4 NORMAL PROCEDURES If the airplane has been operated from muddy fields or in snow or slush, check the main and nose gear wheel fairings for obstructions and cleanliness.  Operation from a gravel or cinder field will require extra attention to propeller tips and abrasion on leading edges of the horizontal tail.  Stone damage to the propeller can seriously reduce the fatigue life of the blades. Airplanes that are operated from rough fields, especially at high altitudes, are subjected to abnormal landing gear abuse.  Frequently check all components of the landing gear, shock strut, tires, and brakes.  If the shock strut is insufficiently extended, undue landing and taxi loads will be subjected on the airplane structure. To prevent loss of fuel in flight, make sure the fuel tank filler caps are tightly sealed after any fuel system check or servicing.  Fuel system vents should also be inspected for obstructions, ice or water, especially after exposure to cold, wet weather. STARTING ENGINE In cooler weather, the engine compartment temperature drops off rapidly following engine shutdown and the injector nozzle lines remain nearly full of fuel. However, in warmer weather, engine compartment temperatures may increase rapidly following engine shutdown, and fuel in the lines will vaporize and escape into the intake manifold.",340.5
53,"Hot weather starting procedures depend considerably on how soon the next engine start is attempted.  Within the first 20 to 30 minutes after shutdown, the fuel manifold is adequately primed and the empty injector nozzle lines will fill before the engine dies.  However, after approximately 30 minutes, the vaporized fuel in the manifold will have nearly dissipated and some slight ""priming"" could be required to refill the nozzle lines and keep the engine running after the initial start.  Starting a hot engine is facilitated by advancing the mixture control promptly to 1 /3 open when the engine starts, and thenl smoothly to full rich as power develops. Revision 4 4-19",168.0
54,"SECTION 4 NORMAL PROCEDURES CESSNA MODEL 172S Should the engine tend to die after starting, turn on the auxiliary fuel pump temporarily and adjust the throttle and/or mixture as necessary to keep the engine running.  In the event of over priming or flooding, turn off the auxiliary fuel pump, open the throttle from 1/2 to full open, and continue cranking with the mixture full lean. IWhen the engine starts, smoothly advance the mixture control to full rich and retard the throttle to desired idle speed. If the engine is under primed (most likely in cold weather with a lcold engine) it will not start at all, and additional priming will be necessary. I After starting, if the oil pressure gage does not begin to show pressure within 30 seconds in the summer time and approximately one minute in very cold weather, stop the engine and investigate. Lack of oil pressure can cause serious engine damage. NOTE Additional details concerning cold weather starting and operation may be found under COLD WEATHER OPERATION paragraphs in this section. !RECOMMENDED STARTER DUTY CYCLE Crank the starter for 10 seconds followed by a 20 second cool down period. This cycle can be repeated two additional times, followed by a ten minute cool down period before resuming cranking.",317.0
54,"After cool down, crank the starter again, three cycles of 10 seconds followed by 20 seconds of cool down.  If the engine still fails to start, an investigation to determine the cause should be initiated. 14-20 Revision 4",55.0
55,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 4 NORMAL PROCEDURES LEANING FOR GROUND OPERATIONS 1.  For all ground operations, after starting the engine and when the engine is running smoothly: a. set the throttle to 1200 RPM. b. lean the mixture for maximum RPM. c. set the throttle to an RPM appropriate for groun operations (800 to 1000 RPM recommended). NOTE If ground operation will be required after the BEFORE TAKEOFF checklist is completed, lean the mixture again (as described above) until ready for the TAKEOFF checklist. TAXIING When taxiing, it is important that speed and use of brakes be held to a minimum and that all controls be utilized (Refer to Figure 4-2, Taxiing Diagram) to maintain directional control and balance. Taxiing over loose gravel or cinders should be done at low engine speed to avoid abrasion and stone damage to the propeller tips. Revision 4 4-21 I",216.25
56,SECTION 4 NORMAL PROCEDURES CESSNA MODEL 172S CODE WIND DIRECTION • 14-22 NOTE Strong quartering tail winds require caution. Avoid sudden bursts of the throttle and sharp braking when the airplane is in this situation. Use the steerable nose wheel and rudder to maintain direction. 0585X1020 Figure 4-2.  Taxiing Diagram Revision 4,82.75
57,"CESSNA MODEL 172S BEFORE TAKE OFF WARM UP SECTION 4 NORMAL PROCEDURES If the engine idles (approximatley 600 RPM) and accelerates smoothly, the airplane is ready for takeoff.  Since the engine is closely cowled for efficient in-flight engine cooling, precautions should be taken to avoid overheating during prolonged engine operation on the ground.  Also, long periods of idling may cause fouled spark plugs. MAGNETO CHECK The magneto check should be made at 1800 RPM as follows. Move ignition switch first to R position and note RPM.  Next move switch back to BOTH to clear the other set of plugs.  Then move switch to the L position, note RPM and return the switch to the BOTH position.  RPM drop should not exceed 150 RPM on either magneto or show greater than 50 RPM differential between magnetos.  If there is a doubt concerning operation of the ignition system, RPM checks at higher engine speeds will usually confirm whether a deficiency exists. An absence of RPM drop may be an indication of faulty grounding of one side of the ignition system or should be cause for suspicion that the magneto timing is set in advance of the setting specified.",288.0
57,"ALTERNATOR CHECK Prior to flights where verification of proper alternator and alternator control unit operation is essential (such as night or instrument flights), a positive verification can be made by loading the electrical system momentarily (3 to 5 seconds) with the landing light or by operating the wing flaps during the engine runup (1800 RPM).  The ammeter will remain within a needle width of its initial reading if the alternator and alternator control unit are operating properly. Revision 4 4-231",127.0
58,"SECTION 4 NORMAL PROCEDURES LANDING LIGHTS CESSNA MODEL 172S If landing lights are to be used to enhance the visibility of the airplane in the traffic pattern or enroute, it is recommended that only the taxi light be used.  This will extend the service life of the landing light appreciably. TAKEOFF POWER CHECK It is important to check full throttle engine operation early in the takeoff roll.  Any sign of rough engine operation or sluggish engine acceleration is good cause for discontinuing the takeoff.  If this occurs, you are justified in making a thorough full throttle static runup before another takeoff is attempted.  The engine should run smoothly and turn approximately 2300 - 2400 RPM with mixture leaned to provide maximum RPM. Full throttle run ups over loose gravel are especially harmful to propeller tips.  When takeoffs must be made over a gravel surface, it is very important that the throttle be advanced slowly.  This allows the airplane to start rolling before high RPM is developed, and the gravel will be blown back of the propeller rather than pulled into it. When unavoidable small dents appear in the propeller blades, they should be immediately corrected as described in Section 8 under Propeller Care.",308.0
58,"Prior to takeoff from fields above 3000 feet elevation, the mixture should be leaned to give maximum RPM in a full throttle, static runup. After full throttle is applied, adjust the throttle friction lock clockwise to prevent the throttle from creeping back from a maximum power position.  Similar friction lock adjustments should be made as required in other flight conditions to maintain a fixed throttle setting. 14-24 Revision 4",108.0
59,"CESSNA MODEL 172S WING FLAP SETTINGS SECTION 4 NORMAL PROCEDURES Normal takeoffs are accomplished with wing flaps 0°-10°.  Using 10° wing flaps reduces the ground roll and total distance over an obstacle by approximately 10 percent.  Flap deflections greaterl than 10° are not approved for takeoff.  If 10° wing flaps are used for takeoff, they should be left down until all obstacles are cleared and a safe flap retraction speed of 60 KIAS is reached.  On a short field, 10° wing flaps and an obstacle clearance speed of 56 KIAS should be used. Soft or rough field takeoffs are performed with 10° flaps by lifting the airplane off the ground as soon as practical in a slightly tail low attitude.  If no obstacles are ahead, the airplane should be leveled off immediately to accelerate to a higher climb speed.  When departing a soft field with an aft C.  G. loading, the elevator trim should be adjusted towards the nose down direction to give comfortable control wheel forces during the initial climb. CROSSWIND TAKEOFF Takeoffs into strong crosswind conditions normally are performed with the minimum flap setting necessary for the field length, to minimize the drift angle immediately after takeoff.  With the ailerons partially deflected into the wind, the airplane is accelerated to a speed slightly higher than normal, then pulled off briskly to prevent possible settling back to the runway while drifting.",353.25
59,"When clear of the ground, make a coordinated turn into the wind to correct for drift. ENROUTE CLIMB Normal enroute climbs are performed with flaps up and fulll throttle and at speeds 5 to 10 knots higher than best rate-of-climb speeds for the best combination of performance, visibility and engine cooling. The mixture should be full rich below 3000 feetl and may be leaned above 3000 feet for smoother operation or to obtain maximum RPM. For maximum rate of climb, use the best rate-of-climb speeds showing in the Rate of Climb chart in Section 5.  If an obstruction dictates the use of a steep climb angle, the best angle-of-climb speed should be used with flaps up and maximum power. Climbs at speeds lower than the best rate-of-climb speed should be of short duration to improve engine cooling. Revision 4 4-251",203.75
60,"SECTION 4 NORMAL PROCEDURES CRUISE CESSNA MODEL 172S I Normal cruise is performed between 45% and 75% power.  The engine RPM and corresponding fuel consumption for various altitudes can be determined by using the data in Section 5. NOTE Cruising should be done at 75% power as much as practicable until a total of 50 hours has accumulated or oil consumption has stabilized.  Operation at this higher power will ensure proper seating of the rings and is applicable to new engines, and engines in service following cylinder replacement or top overhaul of one or more cylinders. I The Cruise Performance charts in Section 5 provide the pilot with detailed information concerning the cruise performance of the Model 172S in still air.  Power and altitude, as well as winds aloft, have a strong influence on the time and fuel needed to complete any flight. The Cruise Performance Table, Figure 4-3, illustrates the true airspeed and nautical miles per gallon during cruise for various altitudes and percent powers, and is based on standard conditions and zero wind.  This table should be used as a guide, along with the available winds aloft information, to determine the most favorable altitude and power setting for a given trip.  The selection of cruise altitude on the basis of the most favorable wind conditions and the use of low power settings are significant factors that should be considered on every trip to reduce fuel consumption. In addition to power settings, proper leaning techniques also contribute to greater range and are figured into cruise performance tables.",393.75
60,"To achieve the recommended lean mixture fuel consumption l figures shown in Section 5, the mixture should be leaned using the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) indicator as noted. NOTE I At lower power it may be necessary to richen the mixture slightly to obtain smooth operation. 14-26 Revision 4",73.25

As the EGT indication begins to increase, continue to slowly lean the mixture until an EGT indication decrease is just detectable. Reverse the adjustment slowly in the rich direction until an EGT indication decrease is again just detectable, then set the EGT index pointer to match the peak indication. The mixture may be leaned slightly to return to peak EGT or may be further richened to Recommended Lean mixture as desired. Continuous operation at mixture settings lean of peak EGT is prohibited.  Any change in altitude or throttle position will require that peak EGT be redetermined and the desired mixture be reset. Under some conditions, engine roughness may occur at peak EGT.",399.5
61,"In this case, operate at Recommended Lean mixture. As noted in Figure 4-4, operation at peak EGT provides the best fuel economy.  Operation at peak EGT results in approximately 4% greater range and approximately a 3 knot decrease in airspeed from the figures shown in the Performance section of this handbook. Recommended Lean mixture provides best level cruise performance (generally close to ""best power"" or maximum RPM). Revision 4",108.5
62,"SECTION 4 CESSNA MODEL 172S NORMAL PROCEDURES NOTE The EGT indicator requires several seconds to respond to mixture adjustments and changes in exhaust gas temperature. More rapid changes in EGT indication are neither necessary nor desirable. Determining peak EGT and setting the desired mixture should take approximately one minute when the adjustments are made sufficiently slowly and accurately. FUEL SAVINGS PROCEDURES FOR FLIGHT TRAINING OPERATIONS For best fuel economy during flight training operations, the following procedures are recommended. 1.  After engine start and for all ground operations, set the throttle to 1200 RPM and lean the mixture for maximum RPM.  Leave the mixture at this setting until beginning the BEFORE TAKEOFF checklist.  After the BEFORE TAKEOFF checklist is complete re-lean the mixture as described above until ready I for the TAKEOFF checklist. I I 2.  Lean the mixture for maximum RPM during full throttle climbs above 3000 feet.",241.75
62,"The mixture may remain leaned (maximum RPM at full throttle) for practicing maneuvers such as stalls and slow flight. 3.  Lean the mixture for maximum RPM during all operations at any altitude, including those below 3000 feet, when using 75% or less power. NOTE •When cruising or maneuvering at 80% or less power, the mixture may be further leaned until the EGT indicator needle peaks and is then enrichened 50°F. This is especially applicable to cross-country training flights, but should be practiced during transition flight to and from the practice area as well. • Using the above recommended procedures can provide fuel savings in excess of 5% when compared to typical training operations at full rich mixture. In addition, the above procedures will minimize spark plug fouling since the reduction in fuel consumption results in a proportional reduction in tetraethyl lead passing through the engine. 14-28 Revision 4",230.5
63,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 4 NORMAL PROCEDURES FUEL VAPOR PROCEDURES The engine fuel system can become susceptible to fuel vapor formation on the ground during warm weather.  This will generally occur when the outside ambient air temperature is above 80°F.  I The situation is further aggravated by the fact that the engine fuel flows are lower at idle and taxi engine speeds.  When vapor occurs as evidenced by idle engine speed and fuel flow fluctuations, the following procedures are recommended. 1.  With the mixture full rich, set the throttle at 1800 RPM to 2000 RPM. Maintain this power setting for 1 to 2 minutes or until smooth engine operation returns. 2.  Retard the throttle to idle to verify normal engine operation. 3.  Advance the throttle to 1200 RPM and lean the mixture as described under FUEL SAVINGS PROCEDURES FOR FLIGHT TRAINING OPERATIONS.",215.25
63,"4.  Just prior to TAKEOFF, apply full throttle, for approximately 10 seconds to verify smooth engine operation for takeoff. NOTE When the engine is operated above 1800 RPM, the resulting increased fuel flow also makes for lower fuel temperatures throughout the engine fuel system. This increased flow purges the fuel vapor and the cooler fuel minimizes vapor formation. In addition to the above procedures, the sections below shoul be reviewed and where applicable, adhered to: Section 2 -- Section 3 -- Section 4 -- Section 7 -- Revision 4 Take note of the placard on ""When Switching From Dry Tank"". Take note of the excessive fuel vapor procedure in both the checklist and the amplified procedure sections. Take note of the hot weather operational notes an procedures in both the checklist and the amplifie procedures sections.

64,"SECTION 4 NORMAL PROCEDURES STALLS CESSNA MODEL 172S The stall characteristics are conventional and aural warning is provided by a stall warning horn which sounds between 5 and 10 knots above the stall in all configurations. Power off stall speeds at maximum weight for both forward and aft C.  G. positions are presented in Section 5. SPINS Intentional spins are approved when the airplane is operated in the utility category.  Spins with baggage loadings or occupied rear seat(s) are not approved. However, before attempting to perform spins several items should be carefully considered to assure a safe flight.  No spins should be attempted without first having received dual instruction both in spin entries and spin recoveries from a qualified instructor who is familiar with the spin characteristics of the Cessna 172S. The cabin should be clean and all loose equipment (including the microphone and rear seat belts) should be stowed or secured.  For a solo flight in which spins will be conducted, the copilot's seat belt and shoulder harness should also be secured. Care should be taken to ensure that the pilot can easily reach the flight controls and produce maximum control travels. It is recommended that, where feasible, entries be accomplished at high enough altitude that recoveries are completed 4000 feet or more above ground level.  At least 1000 feet of altitude loss should be allowed for a Hurn spin and recovery, while a 6-turn spin and recovery may require somewhat more than twice that amount.",379.25
64,"For example, the recommended entry altitude for a 6-turn spin would be 6000 feet above ground level.  In any case, entries should be planned so that recoveries are completed well above the minimum 1500 feet above ground level required by FAR 91.303.  Another reason for using high altitudes for practicing spins is that a greater field of view is provided which will assist in maintaining pilot orientation. L-30 Revision 4",105.75
65,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 4 NORMAL PROCEDURES The normal entry is made from a power off stall.  As the stall is approached, the elevator control should be smoothly pulled to the full aft position.  Just prior to reaching the stall ""break"", rudder control in the desired direction of the spin rotation should be applied so that full rudder deflection is reached almost simultaneously with reaching full aft elevator.  A slightly greater rate of deceleration than for normal stall entries, application of ailerons in the direction of the desired spin, and the use of power at the entry will assure more consistent and positive entries to the spin.  As the airplane begins to spin, reduce the power to idle and return the ailerons to neutral. Both elevator and rudder controls should be held full with the spin until the spin recovery is initiated.  An inadvertent relaxation of either of these controls could result in the development of a nose down spiral. For the purpose of training in spins and spin recoveries, a 1 or 2 turn spin is adequate and should be used.  Up to 2 turns, the spin will progress to a fairly rapid rate of rotation and a steep attitude. Application of recovery controls will produce prompt recoveries (within 1/4 turn).",310.75
65,"During extended spins of two to three turns or more, the spin will tend to change into a spiral, particularly to the right.  This will be accompanied by an increase in airspeed and gravity loads on the airplane.  If this occurs, recovery should be accomplished promptly but smoothly by leveling the wings and recovering from the resulting dive. Regardless of how many turns the spin is held or how it is entered, the following recovery technique should be used: 1.  VERIFY THAT THROTTLE IS IN IDLE POSITION AND AILERONS ARE NEUTRAL. 2.  APPLY AND HOLD FULL RUDDER OPPOSITE TO THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION. 3.  JUST AFTER THE RUDDER REACHES THE STOP, MOVE THE CONTROL WHEEL BRISKLY FORWARD FAR ENOUGH TO BREAK THE STALL. 4.",179.75
65,"HOLD THESE CONTROL INPUTS UNTIL ROTATION STOPS. 5.  AS ROTATION STOPS, NEUTRALIZE RUDDER, AND MAKE A SMOOTH RECOVERY FROM THE RES UL TING DIVE. Revision 4 4-311",40.0
66,"SECTION 4 NORMAL PROCEDURES NOTE CESSNA MODEL 172S If disorientation precludes a visual determination of the direction of rotation, the symbolic airplane in the turn coordinator may be referred to for this information. Variations in basic airplane rigging or in weight and balance due to installed equipment or right seat occupancy can cause differences in behavior, particularly in extended spins.  These differences are normal and will result in variations in the spin characteristics and in the spiraling tendencies for spins of more than 2 turns.  However, the recovery technique should always be used and will result in the most expeditious recovery from any spin. Intentional spins with flaps extended are prohibited, since the high speeds which may occur during recovery are potentially damaging to the flap/wing structure. LANDING NORMAL LANDING Normal landing approaches can be made with power on or power off with any flap setting desired.  Surface winds and air turbulence are usually the primary factors in determining the most comfortable approach speeds.  Steep slips should be avoided with flap settings greater than 20° due to a slight tendency for the elevator to oscillate under certain combinations of airspeed, sideslip angle, and center of gravity loadings. Actual touchdown should be made with power off and on the main wheels first to reduce the landing speed and subsequent need for braking in the landing roll.  The nose wheel is lowered to the runway gently after the speed has diminished to avoid unnecessary nose gear loads.",388.0
66,This procedure is especially important in rough or soft field landings. 14-32 Revision 4,22.0
67,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SHORT FIELD LANDING SECTION 4 NORMAL PROCEDURES For a short field landing in smooth air conditions, make an approach at 61 KIAS with 30° flaps using enough power to control the glide path. (Slightly higher approach speeds should be used under turbulent air conditions.)After all approach obstacles are cleared, progressively reduce power and maintain the approach speed by lowering the nose of the airplane.  Touchdown should be made with power off and on the main wheels first.  Immediately after touchdown, lower the nose wheel and apply heavy braking as required.  For maximum brake effectiveness, retract the flaps, hold the control wheel full back, and apply maximum brake pressure without sliding the tires. CROSSWIND LANDING When landing in a strong crosswind, use the minimum flap setting required for the field length.  If flap settings greater than 20° are used in sideslips with full rudder deflection, some elevator oscillation may be felt at normal approach speeds.  However, this does not affect control of the airplane.  Although the crab or combination method of drift correction may be used, the wing low method gives the best control.",292.5
67,"After touchdown, hold a straight course with the steerable nose wheel and occasional braking if necessary. The maximum allowable crosswind velocity is dependent upon pilot capability as well as airplane limitations.  Operation in direct crosswinds of 15 knots has been demonstrated. BALKED LANDING In a balked landing (go-around) climb, reduce the flap setting to 20° immediately after full power is applied.  If obstacles must be cleared during the go-around climb, reduce the wing flap setting to 10° and maintain a safe airspeed until the obstacles are cleared. Above 3000 feet, lean the mixture to obtain maximum RPM.  After clearing any obstacles, the flaps may be retracted as the airplane accelerates to the normal flaps up climb speed. Revision 4 4-331",190.0
68,"SECTION 4 CESSNA MODEL 172S NORMAL PROCEDURES I COLD WEATHER OPERATION Special consideration should be given to the operation of the airplane fuel system during the winter season or prior to any flight in cold temperatures.  Proper preflight draining of the fuel system is especially important and will eliminate any free water accumulation. The use of additives such as isopropyl alcohol or diethylene glycol monomethyl ether may also be desirable.  Refer to Section 8 for information on the proper use of additives. Cold weather often causes conditions which require special care during airplane operations.  Even small accumulations of frost, ice, or snow must be removed, particularly from wing, tail and all control surfaces to assure satisfactory flight performance and handling. Also, control surfaces must be free of any internal accumulations of ice or snow. If snow or slush covers the takeoff surface, allowance must be made for takeoff distances which will be increasingly extended as the snow or slush depth increases.  The depth and consistency of this cover can, in fact, prevent takeoff in many instances. AwARNING WHEN PULLING THE PROPELLER THROUGH BY HAND, TREAT IT AS IF THE IGNITION SWITCH IS TURNED ON.",305.75
68,"A LOOSE OR BROKEN GROUND WIRE ON EITHER MAGNETO COULD CAUSE THE ENGINE TO FIRE. Prior to starting on cold mornings, it is advisable to pull the propeller through several times by hand to ""break loose"" or ""limber"" the oil, thus conserving battery energy. When air temperatures are below 20°F (-6°C), the use of an external preheater and an external power source are recommended whenever possible to obtain positive starting and to reduce wear and abuse to the engine and electrical system.  Preheat will thaw the oil trapped in the oil cooler, which probably will be congealed prior to starting in extremely cold temperatures. 14-34 Revision 4",160.5
69,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 4 NORMAL PROCEDURES When using an external power source, the master switch must be in the OFF position before connecting the external power source to the airplane receptacle.  See Section 7, Ground Service Plug Recepta- cle for external power source operations. Cold weather starting procedures are the same as the normal starting procedures.  Use caution to prevent inadvertent forward movement of the airplane during starting when parked on snow or ice. NOTE If the engine does not start during the first few attempts, or if engine firing diminishes in strength, it is probable that the spark plugs have been frosted over.  Preheat must be used before another start is attempted. During cold weather operations, no indication will be apparent on the oil temperature gage prior to takeoff if outside air temperatures are very cold.  After a suitable warm up period (2 to 5 minutes at 1000 RPM), accelerate the engine several times to higher engine RPM.  If the engine accelerates smoothly and the oil pressure re- mains normal and steady, the airplane is ready for takeoff. WINTERIZATION KIT A winterization kit is provided and may be utilized when cold weath- er operations are conducted.",304.0
70,"SECTION 4 NORMAL PROCEDURES HOT WEATHER OPERATION CESSNA MODEL 172S Refer to the general warm temperature starting information under Starting Engine in this section.  Avoid prolonged engine operation on the ground. NOISE CHARACTERISTICS AND NOISE REDUCTION The certificated noise level for the Model 172S at 2550 pounds maximum weight is 75.1 dB(A).  No determination has been made by the Federal Aviation Administration that the noise levels of this airplane are or should be acceptable or unacceptable for operation at, into, or out of, any airport. The following procedures are suggested to minimize the effect of airplane noise on the public: 1.  Pilots operating airplanes under VFR over outdoor assemblies of persons, recreational and park areas, and other noise sensitive areas should make every effort to fly not less than 2000 feet above the surface, weather permitting, even though flight at a lower level may be consistent with the provisions of government regulations. 2.  During departure from or approach to an airport, climb after takeoff and descent for landing should be made so as to avoid prolonged flight at low altitude near noise sensitive areas. NOTE The above recommended procedures do not apply where they would conflict with Air Traffic Control clearances or instructions, or where, in the pilot's judgment, an altitude of less than 2000 feet is necessary to adequately exercise the duty to see and avoid other airplanes. 14-36 Revision 4",366.0

73,"CESSNA MODEL 172S INTRODUCTION SECTION 5 PERFORMANCE Performance data charts on the following pages are presented so that you may know what to expect from the airplane under various conditions, and also, to facilitate the planning of flights in detail and with reasonable accuracy.  The data in the charts has been computed from actual flight tests with the airplane and engine in good condition and approximating average piloting techniques. It should be noted that performance information presented in the range and endurance profile charts allows for 45 minutes reserve fuel at the specified power setting.  Fuel flow data for cruise is based on the recommended lean mixture setting at all altitudes.  Some indeterminate variables such as mixture leaning technique, fuel metering characteristics, engine and propeller condition, and air turbulence may account for variations of 10% or more in range and endurance.  Therefore, it is important to utilize all available information to estimate the fuel required for the particular flight and to flight plan in a conservative manner. USE OF PERFORMANCE CHARTS Performance data is presented in tabular or graphical form to illustrate the effect of different variables.  Sufficiently detailed information is provided in the tables so that conservative values can be selected and used to determine the particular performance figure with reasonable accuracy. SAMPLE PROBLEM The following sample flight problem utilizes information from the various charts to determine the predicted performance data for a typical flight.  Assume the following information has already been determined: AIRPLANE CONFIGURATION: Takeoff weight Usable fuel TAKEOFF CONDITIONS: Field pressure altitude Temperature Wind component along runway Field length July 8/98 2550 Pounds 53 Gallons 1500 Feet 28°C (16°C Above Standard) 12 Knot Headwind 3500 Feet 5-3",469.25
74,"SECTION 5 PERFORMANCE CESSNA MODEL 172S CRUISE CONDITIONS: Total distance Pressure altitude Temperature Expected wind enroute LANDING CONDITIONS: Field pressure altitude Temperature Field length 360 Nautical Miles 7500 Feet 16°C (16°C Above Standard) 10 Knot Headwind 2000 Feet 25°C 3000 Feet TAKEOFF The takeoff distance chart, Figure 5-5, should be consulted, keeping in mind that distances shown are based on the short field technique.  Conservative distances can be established by reading the chart at the next higher value of weight, altitude and temperature.  For example, in this particular sample problem, the takeoff distance information presented for a weight of 2550 pounds, pressure altitude of 2000 feet and a temperature of 30°C should be used and results in the following: Ground roll 1285 Feet Total distance to clear a 50-foot obstacle 2190 Feet These distances are well within the available takeoff field length. However, a correction for the effect of wind may be made based on Note 3 of the takeoff chart.  The correction for a 12 knot headwind is: 12 Knots X 1 0% = 13% Decrease 9 Knots This results in the following distances, corrected for wind: 5-4 Ground roll, zero wind Decrease in ground roll (1285 feet X 13%) Corrected ground roll 1285 -167 1118 Feet July 8/98",322.25

A typical cruising altitude and the expected wind enroute have been given for this sample problem.  However, the power setting selection for cruise must be determined based on several considerations.  These include the cruise performance characteristics presented in Figure 5-8, the range profile chart presented in Figure 5-9, and the endurance profile chart presented in Figure 5-10. The relationship between power and range is illustrated by the range profile chart.  Considerable fuel savings and longer range result when lower power settings are used.  For this sample problem, a cruise power of approximately 65% will be used. The cruise performance chart, Figure 5-8, is entered at 8000 feet pressure altitude and 20°C above standard temperature.  Thesel values most nearly correspond to the planned altitude and expected temperature conditions.  The engine speed chosen is 2600 RPM, which results in the following: Revision 4 Power True airspeed Cruise fuel flow 64% 117 Knots 8.9 GPH 5-5",335.5
76,"SECTION 5 PERFORMANCE FUEL REQUIRED CESSNA MODEL 172S The total fuel requirement for the flight may be estimated using the performance information in Figure 5-7 and Figure 5-8.  For this sample problem, Figure 5-7 shows that a climb from 2000 feet to 8000 feet requires 2.2 gallons of fuel.  The corresponding distance during the climb is 15 nautical miles.  These values are for a standard temperature and are sufficiently accurate for most flight planning purposes.  However, a further correction for the effect of temperature may be made as noted on the climb chart.  The approximate effect of a non-standard temperature is to increase the time, fuel, and distance by 10% for each 10°C above standard temperature, due to the lower rate of climb.  In this case, assuming a temperature 16°C above standard (16°C - 0°C), the correction would be: 16°C X 10% = 16% Increase 10°C IWith this factor included, the fuel estimate would be calculated as follows: Fuel to climb, standard temperature Increase due to non-standard temperature (2.2 x 16%) Corrected fuel to climb 2.2 0.4 2.6 Gallons Using a similar procedure for the distance to climb results in 18 nautical miles. (15 nm using chart + 2.4 nm to correct for higher than standard temperature= 17.4 nm.  Rounded up to 18 nm.) 5-6 Revision 4",323.25
77,"CESSNA MODEL 172S The resultant cruise distance is: Total distance Climb distance Cruise distance SECTION 5 PERFORMANCE 360 -18 342 nm With an expected 10 knot headwind, the ground speed for cruise is predicted to be: 117 -10 107 Knots Therefore, the time required for the cruise portion of the trip is: 342 Nautical Miles = 3.2 Hours 107 Knots The fuel required for cruise is: 3.2 hours X 8.9 gallons/hour = 28.5 Gallons A 45-minute reserve requires: 45 60 X 8.9 gallons I hour= 6.7 Gallons The total estimated fuel required is as follows: Engine start, taxi, and takeoff Climb Cruise Reserve Total fuel required 1.4 2.6 28.5 6.7 39.2 Gallons Once the flight is underway, ground speed checks will provide a more accurate basis for estimating the time enroute and the corresponding fuel required to complete the trip with ample reserve.

78,"SECTION 5 PERFORMANCE LANDING CESSNA MODEL 172S A procedure similar to takeoff should be used for estimating the landing distance at the destination airport.  Figure 5-11 presents landing distance information for the short field technique.  The distances corresponding to 2000 feet and 30°C are as follows: Ground roll 650 Feet Total distance to clear a 50-foot obstacle 1455 Feet A correction for the effect of wind may be made based on Note 2 of the landing chart, using the same procedure as outlined for takeoff. DEMONSTRATED OPERATING TEMPERATURE Satisfactory engine cooling has been demonstrated for this airplane with an outside air temperature 23°C above standard.

100,"6.  Basic Empty Weight may be determined by completing Figure 6-1. WEIGHT AND BALANCE The following information will enable you to operate your Cessna within the prescribed weight and center of gravity limitations.  To lcalculate weight and balance, use the Sample Loading Problem, Loading Graph, and Center of Gravity Moment Envelope as follows: Take the basic empty weight and moment from appropriate weight and balance records carried in your airplane, and enter them in the column titled YOUR AIRPLANE on the Sample Loading Problem. NOTE In addition to the basic empty weight and moment noted on these records, the C.  G. arm (fuselage station) is also shown, but need not be used on the Sample Loading Problem.  The moment which is shown must be divided by 1000 and this value used as the moment/1000 on the loading problem.

102,"SECTION 6 CESSNA MODEL 172S WEIGHT & BALANCE I EQUIPMENT LIST NOTE Loading Graph information for the pilot, passengers and baggage is based on seats positioned for average occupants and baggage loaded in the center of the baggage areas as shown on the Loading Arrangements diagram.  For loadings which may differ from these, the Sample Loading Problem lists fuselage stations for these items to indicate their forward and aft C.  G. range limitations (seat travel and baggage area limitation).  Additional moment calculations, based on the actual weight and C.  G. arm (fuselage station) of the item being loaded, must be made if the position of the load is different from that shown on the Loading Graph. Total the weights and moments/1000 and plot these values on the Center of Gravity Moment Envelope to determine whether the point falls within the envelope, and if the loading is acceptable. BAGGAGE TIE-DOWN A nylon baggage net having tie-down straps is provided as standard equipment to secure baggage on the cabin floor aft of the rear seat (baggage area 1) and in the aft baggage area (baggage area 2).  Six eyebolts serve as attaching points for the net.  Two eyebolts for the forward tie-down straps are mounted on the cabin floor near each sidewall just forward of the baggage door approximately at station 90; two eyebolts are installed on the cabin floor slightly inboard of each sidewall approximately at station 107; and two eyebolts are located below the aft window near each sidewall approximately at station 107.  A placard on the baggage door defines the weight limitations in the baggage areas. When baggage area 1 is utilized for baggage only, the two forward floor mounted eyebolts and the two aft floor mounted eyebolts (or the two eyebolts below the aft window) may be used, depending on the height of the baggage.  When baggage is carried in the baggage area 2 only, the aft floor mounted eyebolts and the eyebolts below the aft window should be used.",494.0

This comprehensive equipment list provides the following information in column form: In the ITEM NO column, each item is assigned a coded number.  The first two digits of the code represent the assignment of the item within the Air Transport Association Specification 100 breakdown (11 for Paint and Placards, 24 for Electrical Power, 77 for Engine Indicating, etc ... ).  These assignments also correspond to the Maintenance Manual chapter breakdown for the airplane.  After the first two digits (and hyphen), items receive a unique sequence number (01, 02, 03, etc ... ).  After the sequence number (and hyphen), a suffix letter is assigned to identify equipment as a required item, a standard item or an optional item.  Suffix letters are as follows: -R required items or equipment for FAA certification -S standard equipment items -0 optional equipment items replacing required or standard items -A optional equipment items which are in addition to required or standard items In the EQUIPMENT LIST DESCRIPTION column, each item is assigned a descriptive name to help identify its function. In the REF DRAWING column, a Cessna drawing number is provided which corresponds to the item. NOTE If additional equipment is to be installed, it must be done in accordance with the reference drawing, service bulletin or a separate FAA approval. In the WT LBS and ARM INS columns, information is provided on the weight (in pounds) and arm (in inches) of the equipment item.",422.0

125,"CESSNA MODEL 172S INTRODUCTION SECTION 7 AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION This section provides description and operation of the airplane and its systems.  Some equipment described herein is optional and may not be installed in the airplane.  Refer to the Supplements,I Section 9, for details of other optional systems and equipment. AIRFRAME The airplane is an all metal, four-place, high wing, single enginel airplane equipped with tricycle landing gear and is designed for general utility and training purposes. The construction of the fuselage is a conventional formed sheet metal bulkhead, stringer, and skin design referred to as semimonocoque. Major items of structure are the front and rear carry through spars to which the wings are attached, a bulkhead and forgings for main landing gear attachment at the base of the rear door posts, and a bulkhead with attach fittings at the base of the forward door posts for the lower attachment of the wing struts. Four engine mount stringers are also attached to the forward door posts and extend forward to the firewall. The externally braced wings, containing integral fuel tanks, are constructed of a front and rear spar with formed sheet metal ribs, doublers, and stringers. The entire structure is covered with aluminum skin.  The front spars are equipped with wing-to-fuselage and wing-to-strut attach fittings.",341.25
125,"The aft spars are equipped with wing-to-fuselage attach fittings, and are partial span spars. Conventional hinged ailerons and single slot type flaps are attached to the trailing edge of the wings.  The ailerons are constructed of a forward spar containing balance weights, formed sheet metal ribs and ""V"" type corrugated aluminum skin joined together at the trailing edge.  The flaps are constructed basically the same as the ailerons, with the exception of the balance weights and the addition of a formed sheet metal leading edge section. May 30/00 7-5",138.75
126,"SECTION 7 AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION CESSNA MODEL 172S The empennage (tail assembly) consists of a conventional verti- cal stabilizer, rudder, horizontal stabilizer, and elevator.  The vertical stabilizer consists of a spar, formed sheet metal ribs and reinforce- ments, a wraparound skin panel, formed leading edge skin and a dorsal.  The rudder is constructed of a formed leading edge skin and spar with attached hinge brackets and ribs, a center spar, a wrap around skin, and a ground adjustable trim tab at the base of the trailing edge.  The top of the rudder incorporates a leading edge ex- tension which contains a balance weight. The horizontal stabilizer is constructed of a forward and aft spar, ribs and stiffeners, center, left, and right wrap around skin panels, and formed leading edge skins.  The horizontal stabilizer also contains the elevator trim tab actuator. Construction of the elevator consists of formed leading edge skins, a forward spar, aft channel, ribs, torque tube and bellcrank, left upper and lower ""V"" type corrugated skins, and right upper and lower ""V"" type corrugated skins incorporating a trailing edge cutout for the trim tab.  The elevator tip leading edge extensions incorporate balance weights.  The elevator trim tab consists of a spar, rib, and upper and lower ""V"" type corrugated skins. FLIGHT CONTROLS The airplane's flight control system (Refer to Figure 7-1) consists of conventional aileron, rudder, and elevator control surfaces.",370.5
126,"The control surfaces are manually operated through cables and mechanical linkage using a control wheel for the ailerons and elevator, and rudder/brake pedals for the rudder. TRIM SYSTEM A manually operated elevator trim system is provided (Refer to Figure 7-1 ).  Elevator trimming is accomplished through the elevator trim tab by utilizing the vertically mounted trim control wheel in the cockpit.  Forward rotation of the trim wheel will trim nose down; conversely, aft rotation will trim nose up. 7-6 July 8/98",128.25

Below this sub panel are the glove box, cabin heat and cabin air controls, and wing flap switch. CENTER PE DEST AL LAYOUT The center pedestal, located below the center panel, contains the elevator trim control wheel, position indicator, handheld microphone bracket and fuel shutoff valve control.  The fuel selector valve handle I is located at the base of the pedestal. GROUND CONTROL Effective ground control while taxiing is accomplished through nose wheel steering by using the rudder pedals; left rudder pedal to steer left and right rudder pedal to steer right.  When a rudder pedal is depressed, a spring loaded steering bungee (which is connected to the nose gear and to the rudder bars) will turn the nose wheel through an arc of approximately 10° each side of center.  By applying either left or right brake, the degree of turn may be increased up to 30° each side of center. Moving the airplane by hand is most easily accomplished by attaching a tow bar to the nose gear strut.  If a tow bar is not available, or pushing is required, use the wing struts as push points. Do not use the vertical or horizontal surfaces to move the airplane.",337.5
132,"If the airplane is to be towed by vehicle, never turn the nose wheel more than 30° either side of center or structural damage to the nose gear could result. The minimum turning radius of the airplane, using differential l braking and nose wheel steering during taxi, is approximately 27 feet.  To obtain a minimum radius turn during ground handling, the airplane may be rotated around either main landing gear by pressing down on a tailcone bulkhead just forward of the horizontal stabilizer to raise the nose wheel off the ground.  Care should be exercised to ensure that pressure is exerted only on the bulkhead l area and not on skin between the bulkheads.  Pressing down on the horizontal stabilizer is not recommended. 7-12 Revision 4",184.75
133,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 7 AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION WING FLAP SYSTEM The single-slot type wing flaps (Refer to Figure 7-3), are extended or retracted by positioning the wing flap switch lever on the instrument panel to the desired flap deflection position.  The switch lever is moved up or down in a slotted panel that provides mechanical stops at the 1 0°, 20° and 30° positions.  To change I flap setting, the flap lever is moved to the right to clear mechanical stops at the 1 0° and 20° positions.  A scale and pointer to the left of the flap switch indicates flap travel in degrees.  The wing flap system circuit is protected by a 10-ampere circuit breaker, labeled FLAP, on the left side of the control panel. 0585X1021 Figure 7-3.  Wing Flap System Revision 4 7-13",194.5
134,"SECTION 7 AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION LANDING GEAR SYSTEM CESSNA MODEL 172S The landing gear is of the tricycle type, with a steerable nose wheel and two main wheels.  Wheel fairings are standard equipment for both the main and nose wheels.  Shock absorption is provided by the tubular spring steel main landing gear struts and the air/oil nose gear shock strut.  Each main gear wheel is equipped with a hydraulically actuated disc type brake on the inboard side of each wheel. BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT The baggage compartment consists of two areas, one extending from behind the rear passengers seat to the aft cabin bulkhead, and an additional area aft of the bulkhead.  Access to both baggage areas is gained through a lockable baggage door on the left side of the airplane, or from within the airplane cabin.  A baggage net with tiedown straps is provided for securing baggage and is attached by tying the straps to tiedown rings provided in the airplane.  For baggage area and door dimensions, refer to Section 6. SEATS The seating arrangement consists of two vertically adjusting crew seats for the pilot and front seat passenger, and a single bench seat with adjustable back for rear seat passengers. Seats used for the pilot and front seat passenger are adjustable fore and aft, and up and down.",325.25
134,"Additionally, the angle of the seat back is infinitely adjustable. I Fore and aft adjustment is made using the handle located below the center of the seat frame.  To position the seat, lift the handle, slide the seat into position, release the handle and check that the seat is locked in place.  To adjust the height of the seat, rotate the large crank under the right hand corner of the seat until a comfortable height is obtained.  To adjust the seat back angle, pull up on the release button, located in the center front of seat, just under the seat bottom, position the seat back to the desired angle, and release the button.  When the seat is not occupied, the seat back will automatically fold forward whenever the release button is pulled up. 7-14 May 30/00",191.0
135,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 7 AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION The rear passengers' seat consists of a fixed, one piece seat bottom and a three-position, reclining back.  The reclining back is adjusted by a lever located below the center of the seat frame.  To adjust the seat back, raise the lever, position the seat back to the desired angle, release the lever and check that the back is locked in place. Headrests are installed on both the front and rear seats.  To adjust the headrest, apply enough pressure to it to raise or lower it to the desired level. INTEGRATED SEATBELT/SHOULDER HARNESS All seat positions are equipped with integrated seat belts/shoulder harness assemblies (Refer to Figure 7-4).  The design incorporates an overhead inertia reel for the shoulder portion, and a retractor assembly for the lap portion of the belt.  This design allows for complete freedom of movement of the upper torso area while providing restraint in the lap belt area.  In the event of a sudden deceleration, reels lock up to provide positive restraint for the user. In the front seats, the inertia reels are located on the centerline of the upper cabin.",287.0
135,"In the rear seats, the inertia reels are located outboard of each passenger in the upper cabin. To use the integrated seat belt/shoulder harness, grasp the link with one hand, and, in a single motion, extend the assembly and., insert into the buckle.  Positive locking has occurred when al distinctive ""snap"" sound is heard. Proper locking of the lap belt can be verified by ensuring that the belts are allowed to retract into the retractors and the lap belt is snug and low on the waist as worn normally during flight.  No more than one additional inch of belt should be able to be pulled out of the retractor once the lap belt is in place on the occupant.  If more than one additional inch of belt can be pulled out of the retractor, the occupant is too small for the installed restraint system and the aircraft should not be occupied until the occupant is properlyl restrained. Removal is accomplished by lifting the release mechanism onl the buckle or by pressing the release button on the buckle and pulling out and up on the harness.  Spring tension on the inertia reel will automatically stow the harness. May 30/00 7-15",281.75

To use the manually adjustable seat belt/shoulder harness, fasten and adjust the seat belt/shoulder harness first.  Lengthen the seat belt as required by pulling on the release strap on the belt. Snap the connecting link firmly into the buckle, then adjust to length.  A properly adjusted harness will permit the occupant to lean forward enough to sit erect, but prevent excessive forward movement and contact with objects during sudden deceleration. Also, the pilot must have the freedom to reach all controls easily. Disconnecting the manually adjustable seat belt/shoulder harness is accomplished by pushing the button on the buckle to release the connecting link. ENTRANCE DOORS AND CABIN WINDOWS Entry to, and exit from the airplane is accomplished through either of two entry doors, one on each side of the cabin at the front seat positions (refer to Section 6 for cabin and cabin door dimensions).  The doors incorporate a recessed exterior door handle, a conventional interior door handle, a key operated door lock (left door only), a door stop mechanism, and openable windows in both the left and right doors. NOTE The door latch design on this model requires that the outside door handle on the pilot and front passenger doors be extended out whenever the doors are open.",356.25
137,"When closing the door, do not attempt to push the door handle in until the door is fully shut. To open the doors from outside the airplane, utilize the recessed door handle near the aft edge of either door by grasping the forward edge of the handle and pulling outboard.  To close or open the doors from inside the airplane, use the combination door handle and arm rest.  The inside door handle has three positions and a placard at its base which reads OPEN, CLOSE, and LOCK.  The handle is spring loaded to the CLOSE (up) position.  When the door has been pulled shut and latched, lock it by rotating the door handle forward to the LOCK position (flush with the arm rest).  When the handle is rotated to the LOCK position, an over center action will hold it in that position.  Both cabin doors should be locked prior to flight, and should not be opened intentionally during flight. May 30/00 7-17",224.25
138,"SECTION 7 CESSNA MODEL 172S AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION NOTE Accidental opening of a cabin door in flight due to improper closing does not constitute a need to land the airplane.  The best procedure is to set up the airplane in a trimmed condition at approximately 75 KIAS, momentarily shove the door outward slightly, and forcefully close and lock the door. Exit from the airplane is accomplished by rotating the door handle from the LOCK position, past the CLOSE position, aft to the OPEN position and pushing the door open.  To lock the airplane, lock the right cabin door with the inside handle, close the left cabin door, and using the ignition key, lock the door. The left and right cabin doors are equipped with openable windows which are held in the closed position by a detent equipped latch on the lower edge of the window frame.  To open the windows, lrotate the latch upward.  Each window is equipped with a spring- loaded retaining arm which will help rotate the window outward, and hold it there. If required, either window may be opened at any speed up to 163 KIAS.  The rear side windows and rear windows are of the fixed type and cannot be opened. CONTROL LOCKS A control lock is provided to lock the aileron and elevator control surfaces to prevent damage to these systems by wind buffeting while the airplane is parked.",335.25
138,"The lock consists of a shaped steel rod and flag.  The flag identifies the control lock and cautions about its removal before starting the engine.  To install the control lock, align the hole in the top of the pilot's control wheel shaft with the hole in the top of the shaft collar on the instrument panel and insert the rod into the aligned holes.  Installation of the lock will secure the ailerons in a neutral position and the elevators in a slightly trailing edge down position.  Proper installation of the lock will place the flag over the ignition switch.  In areas where high or gusty winds occur, a control surface lock should be installed over the vertical stabilizer and rudder.  The control lock and any other type of locking device should be removed prior to starting the engine. 7-18 May 30/00",201.75
139,"CESSNA MODEL 172S ENGINE SECTION 7 AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION The airplane is powered by a horizontally opposed, four cylinder, overhead valve, air-cooled, fuel-injected engine with a wet sump lubrication system.  The engine is a Lycoming Model I0-360-L2A and is rated at 180 horsepower at 2700 RPM.  Major accessories include a starter and belt driven alternator mounted on the front of the engine, and dual magnetos, dual vacuum pumps, and a full flow oil filter mounted on the rear of the engine accessory case. ENGINE CONTROLS Engine power is controlled by a throttle located on the switch and control panel above the center pedestal.  The throttle is open in thel full forward position and closed in the full aft position.  A friction lock, which is a round knurled knob, is located at the base of the throttle and is operated by rotating the lock clockwise to increase friction or counterclockwise to decrease it. The mixture control, mounted adjacent to the throttle control, is a red knob with raised points around the circumference and is equipped with a lock button in the end of the knob.  The rich position is full forward, and full aft is the idle cutoff position.  For small adjustments, the control may be moved forward by rotating the knob clockwise, and aft by rotating the knob counterclockwise.  For rapid or large adjustments, the knob may be moved forward or aft by depressing the lock button in the end of the control, and then positioning the control as desired.",372.25
139,"ENGINE INSTRUMENTS Engine operation is monitored by the following instruments: oil pressure/oil temperature indicator, tachometer and exhaust gas temperature (EGT) indicator.  In addition, the annunciator panel contains a red OIL PRESS annunciator which comes on when the oil pressure is low. See Section 2, Limitations, for engine operating limitations and instrument markings. Revision 4 7-19",98.5
140,"SECTION 7 CESSNA MODEL 172S AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION I Oil pressure signals are generated from an oil pressure line/transducer combination.  An oil pressure line is routed from the upper front of the engine case to the rear engine baffle.  At the baffle, the oil pressure line is connected to a transducer.  This !transducer produces an electrical signal which is translated into a pressure reading by the oil pressure gage located on the LH instrument panel. In addition, a separate low oil pressure indication is provided through the panel annunciator.  This annunciator is wired to a pressure switch located on the rear of the engine accessory case. When oil pressure is below 20 PSI, the switch grounds and completes the annunciator circuit, illuminating the red OIL PRESS light.  When pressure exceeds 20 PSI, the ground is removed and the OIL PRESS annunciator goes out. NOTE The low oil pressure switch is also connected to the hour (Hobbs) meter.",240.0
140,"When pressure exceeds 20 PSI, a ground is supplied to the hour meter, completing the hour meter circuit. Oil temperature signals are generated from a resistance-type probe located in the engine accessory case.  As oil temperature changes, the probe resistance changes. This resistance is translated into oil temperature readings on the cockpit indicator. The engine driven mechanical tachometer is located on the instrument panel to the right of the pilot's control wheel.  The instrument is calibrated in increments of 100 RPM and indicates both engine and propeller speed.  An hour meter in the lower section of the dial records elapsed engine time in hours and tenths. Instrument markings include the normal operating range (green arc) from 1900 to 2400 RPM. The exhaust gas temperature (EGT) indicator is located on the LH instrument panel as part of the EGT/Fuel Flow indicator.  Since exhaust gas temperature varies with fuel-air ration (mixture), density altitude, throttle position and RPM, the instrument is a useful aid in adjusting the mixture for best economy or performance.",271.75
140,"The EGT indicator allows the pilot to lean (reduce the proportion of fuel in the fuel-air mixture) to a known value using the maximum or ""peak"" exhaust gas temperature as a reference. An index pointer which can be positioned manually is provided for the pilot to mark the location of the peak. Never lean using EGT when operating at more than 75% power. 7-20 Revision 4",92.25
141,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 7 AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION The EGT system uses a thermocouple in the engine exhaust (tailpipe) to supply a voltage proportional to exhaust gas temperature.  The EGT indicator responds to the voltage developed by the thermocouple.  As the mixture is leaned (from full rich), the exhaust gas temperature will increase to a maximum value as the stoichiometric (most chemically efficient) fuel-air ratio is achieved and will decrease if the mixture continues to be leaned. NEW ENGINE BREAK-IN AND OPERATION The engine underwent a run in at the factory and is ready for the full range of use.  It is, however, suggested that cruising be accomplished at 75% power as much as practicable until a total of 50 hours has accumulated or oil consumption has stabilized.  This will ensure proper seating of the piston rings. ENGINE LUBRICATION SYSTEM The engine utilizes a full-pressure, wet-sump type lubrication system with aviation-grade oil used as the lubricant.  The capacity of the engine sump (located on the bottom of the engine) is eight quarts.  Oil is drawn from the sump through an oil suction strainer screen into the engine-driven oil pump.  From the pump, oil is routed to a bypass valve.",305.75
141,"If the oil is cold, the bypass valve allows the oil to bypass the oil cooler and go directly from the pump to the full flow oil filter.  If the oil is hot, the bypass valve routes the oil out of the accessory housing and into a flexible hose leading to the oil cooler on the right, rear engine baffle.  Pressure oil from the cooler returns to the accessory housing where it passes through the full flow oil filter.  The filter oil then enters a pressure relief valve which regulates engine oil pressure by allowing excessive oil to return to the sump while the balance of the oil is circulated to various engine parts for lubrication.  Residual oil is returned to the sump by gravity flow. An oil filler cap/oil dipstick is located at the right rear of the engine.  The filler cap/ dipstick is accessible through an access door on the top right side of the engine cowling.  The engine should not be operated on less than five quarts of oil.  For extended flight, fill to eight quarts (dipstick indication only).  For engine oil grade and specifications, refer to Section 8 of this handbook.",272.5
142,"SECTION 7 AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION IGNITION AND STARTER SYSTEM CESSNA MODEL 172S I Engine ignition is provided by two engine-driven magnetos, and two spark plugs in each cylinder.  The right magneto fires the lower right and upper left spark plugs, and the left magneto fires the lower left and upper right spark plugs.  Normal operation is conducted with lboth magnetos due to the more complete burning of the fuel/air mixture with dual ignition. I Ignition and starter operation is controlled by a rotary-type switch located on the left switch and control panel.  The switch is labeled clockwise, OFF, R, L, BOTH, and START.  The engine should be operated on both magnetos (BOTH position) except for magneto checks.  The R and L positions are for checking purposes and emergency use only.  When the switch is rotated to the spring loaded START position, (with the master switch in the ON position), lthe starter contactor is closed and the starter, now energized, will crank the engine.  When the switch is released, it will automatically return to the BOTH position. AIR INDUCTION SYSTEM The engine air induction system receives ram air through an intake on the lower front portion of the engine cowling.",303.25
142,"The intake is covered by an air filter which removes dust and other foreign matter from the induction air.  Airflow passing through the filter enters an air box.  The air box has a spring-loaded alternate air door.  If the air induction filter should become blocked, suction created by the engine will open the door and draw unfiltered air from inside the lower cowl area.  An open alternate air door will result in an approximate 10% power loss at full throttle.  After passing through the air box, induction air enters a fuel/air control unit under the engine, and is then ducted to the engine cylinders through intake manifold tubes. 7-22 May 30/00",162.75
143,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 7 AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION EXHAUST SYSTEM Exhaust gas from each cylinder passes through riser assemblies to a muffler and tailpipe. Outside air is pulled in around shrouds which are constructed around the outside of the muffler to form heating chambers which supply heat to the cabin. COOLING SYSTEM Ram air for engine cooling enters through two intake openings in the front of the engine cowling.  The cooling air is directed around the cylinders and other areas of the engine by baffling, and is then exhausted through an opening at the bottom aft edge of the cowling. No manual cowl flap cooling system control is required. PROPELLER The airplane is equipped with a two bladed, fixed pitch, one- piece forged aluminum alloy propeller which is anodized to retard corrosion.  The propeller is 76 inches in diameter. FUEL SYSTEM The airplane fuel system (see Figure 7-6) consists of two vented integral fuel tanks (one tank in each wing), a three-position selector valve, auxiliary fuel pump, fuel shutoff valve, fuel strainer, enginel driven fuel pump, fuel/air control unit, fuel distribution valve and fuel injection nozzles. AwARNING UNUSABLE FUEL LEVELS FOR THIS AIRPLANE WERE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL AVIATION REGULATIONS.

Fuel Quantity Data in U.  S. Gallons FUEL DISTRIBUTION Fuel flows by gravity from the two wing tanks to a three-position selector valve, labeled BOTH, RIGHT and LEFT and on to the reservoir tank.  From the reservoir tank fuel flows through the auxiliary fuel pump, past the fuel shutoff valve, through the fuel strainer to an engine driven fuel pump. From the engine-driven fuel pump, fuel is delivered to the fuel/air control unit, where it is metered and directed to a fuel distribution valve (manifold) which distributes it to each cylinder.  Fuel flow into each cylinder is continuous, and flow rate is determined by the amount of air passing through the fuel/air control unit. I Starting at serial number 172S9491 and on, and airplanes incorporating MK172-28-01, a fuel return system was added to promote smooth engine operation on the ground during hot weather. The return system carries a metered amount of fuel from the engine fuel-air control unit to the fuel reservoir tank. The increased fuel flow due to the return system results in lower fuel temperatures at the engine inlet, and helps to minimize the amount of fuel vapor generated in the fuel lines during high OAT operations. 7-24 Revision 5",353.5
145,"CESSNA MODEL 172S FUEL INDICATING SECTION 7 AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION Fuel quantity is measured by two float type fuel quantity transmitters (one in each tank) and indicated by an electrically operated fuel quantity indicator on the left side of the instrument panel.  The gauges are marked in gallons of fuel.  An empty tank is indicated by a red line and the number 0.  When an indicator shows an empty tank, approximately 1.5 gallons remain in each tank as unusable fuel.  The indicators should not be relied upon for accurate readings during skids, slips, or unusual attitudes. Each fuel tank also incorporates warning circuits which can detect low fuel conditions and erroneous transmitter messages. Anytime fuel in the tank drops below approximately 5 gallons (and remains below this level for more than 60 seconds), the amber LOW FUEL message will flash on the annunciator panel for approximately 10 seconds and then remain steady amber.  The annunciator cannot be turned off by the pilot.  If the left tank is low, the message will read L LOW FUEL.  If the right tank is low, the message will read LOW FUEL R. If both tanks are low, the message will read L LOW FUEL R. In addition to low fuel annunciation, the warning circuitry is designed to report failures with each transmitter caused by shorts, opens or transmitter resistance which increases over time.",342.75
145,"If the circuitry detects any one of these conditions, the fuel level indicator needle will go to the OFF position (below the 0 mark on the fuel indicator), and the amber annunciator will illuminate.  If the left tankl transmitter has failed, the message will read L LOW FUEL.  If the right tank transmitter has failed, the message will read LOW FUEL R. If both tanks transmitters have failed, the message will read L LOW FUEL R. Fuel pressure is measured by use of a transducer mounted near the fuel manifold.  This transducer produces an electrical signal which is translated for the cockpit-mounted indicator in gallons-per- hour. Revision 4 7-25",162.0
146,"SECTION 7 CESSNA MODEL 172S AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION FUEL VENTING Fuel system venting is essential to system operation.  Blockage of the system will result in decreasing fuel flow and eventual engine stoppage.  Venting is accomplished by an interconnecting line from the right fuel tank to the left tank.  The left fuel tank is vented overboard through a vent line, equipped with a check valve, which protrudes from the bottom surface of the left wing near the wing strut.  Both fuel filler caps are also vented. REDUCED TANK CAPACITY The airplane may be serviced to a reduced capacity to permit heavier cabin loadings.  This is accomplished by filling each tank to the bottom edge of the fuel filler tab, thus giving a reduced fuel load of 17.5 gallons usable in each tank. FUEL SELECTOR VALVE The fuel selector valve should be in the BOTH position for takeoff, climb, landing, and maneuvers that involve prolonged slips or skids of more than 30 seconds.  Operation from either LEFT or RIGHT tank is reserved for cruising flight. 7-26 NOTE When the fuel selector valve handle is in the BOTH position in cruising flight, unequal fuel flow from each tank may occur if the wings are not maintained exactly level.",304.0
146,"Resulting wing heaviness can be alleviated gradually by turning the selector valve handle to the tank in the ""heavy"" wing. It is not practical to measure the time required to consume all of the fuel in one tank, and, after switching to the opposite tank, expect an equal duration from the remaining fuel. The airspace in both fuel tanks is interconnected by a vent line and, therefore, some sloshing of fuel between tanks can be expected when the tanks are nearly full and the wings are not level.

Therefore, if operating with one fuel tank dry or if operating on LEFT or RIGHT tank when 1/4 full or less, do not allow the airplane to remain in uncoordinated flight for periods in excess of 30 seconds. FUEL DRAIN VALVES The fuel system is equipped with drain valves to provide a means for the examination of fuel in the system for contamination and grade.  The system should be examined before each flight and after each refueling, by using the sampler cup provided to drain fuel from each wing tank sump, the fuel reservoir sump, the fuel selector drain and the fuel strainer sump. If any evidence of fuel contamination is found, it must be eliminated in accordance with the Preflight Inspection checklist and the discussion in Section 8 of this publication.  If takeoff weight limitations for the next flight permit, the fuel tanks should be filled after each flight to prevent condensation. 7-28 July 8/98",277.0
151,"CESSNA MODEL 172S BRAKE SYSTEM SECTION 7 AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION The airplane has a single-disc, hydraulically actuated brake on each main landing gear wheel.  Each brake is connected, by a hydraulic line, to a master cylinder attached to each of the pilot's rudder pedals.  The brakes are operated by applying pressure to the top of either the left (pilot's) or right (copilot's) set of rudder pedals, which are interconnected.  When the airplane is parked, both main wheel brakes may be set by utilizing the parking brake which is operated by a handle under the left side of the instrument panel.  To apply the parking brake, set the brakes with the rudder pedals, pull the handle aft, and rotate it 90° down. For maximum brake life, keep the brake system properly maintained, and minimize brake usage during taxi operations and landings. Some of the symptoms of impending brake failure are: gradual decrease in braking action after brake application, noisy or dragging brakes, soft or spongy pedals, and excessive travel and weak braking action.  If any of these symptoms appear, the brake system is in need of immediate attention.  If, during taxi or landing roll, braking action decreases, let up on the pedals and then reapply the brakes with heavy pressure.  If the brakes become spongy or pedal travel increases, pumping the pedals should build braking pressure.",344.25
151,"If one brake becomes weak or fails, use the other brake sparingly while using opposite rudder, as required, to offset the good brake. ELECTRICAL SYSTEM The airplane is equipped with a 28-volt, direct current electricall system (Refer to Figure 7-7).  The system is powered by a belt- driven, 60-amp alternator and a 24-volt battery, located on the left forward side of the firewall.  Power is supplied to most general electrical circuits through a split primary bus bar, with an essential bus wired between the two primaries to provide power for the master switch, annunciator circuits and interior lighting. I Each primary bus bar is also connected to an avionics bus bar via a single avionics master switch.  The primary buses are on anytime the master switch is turned on, and are not affected by starter or external power usage.  The avionics buses are on when the master switch and avionics master switch are in the ON position. May 30/00 7-29",237.0

156,"SECTION 7 CESSNA MODEL 172S AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION I The airplane uses a power distribution module (J-Box), located on the left forward side of the firewall, to house all relays used throughout the airplane electrical system.  In addition, the alternator control unit and the external power connector are housed within the module. ANNUNCIATOR PANEL An annunciator panel (with integral toggle switch) is located on the left side of the instrument panel and provides caution (amber) and warning (red) messages for selected portions of the airplane systems.  The annunciator is designed to flash messages for approximately 10 seconds to gain the attention of the pilot before changing to steady on.  The annunciator panel cannot be turned off by the pilot. Inputs to the annunciator come from each fuel transmitter, the low oil pressure switch, the vacuum transducers and the alternator control unit (ACU).  Individual LED bulbs illuminate each message and may be replaced through the rear of the annunciator. Illumination intensity can be controlled by placing the toggle switch in either the DIM or BRT positions (earlier serial number airplanes) or the DAY or NIGHT positions (later serial number airplanes). The annunciator panel can be tested by placing the Master switch in the ON position and holding the annunciator panel test switch in the TST (earlier serial number airplanes) or the TEST (later serial number airplanes) position. All amber and red messages will flash until the switch is released.",378.25
156,"NOTE When the Master switch is turned ON, some annunciators will flash for approximately 10 seconds before illuminating steadily.  When the annunciator panel test switch is held in the TST (earlier serial number airplanes) or the TEST (later serial number airplanes) position, all remaining lights will flash until the switch is released. 7-32 Revision 4",88.5
157,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 7 AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION MASTER SWITCH The master switch is a split-rocker type switch labeled MASTER,I and is ON in the up position and OFF in the down position.  The right half of the switch, labeled BAT, controls the battery power to the airplane.  The left half, labeled ALT, controls the alternator. AcAUTION PRIOR TO TURNING THE MASTER SWITCH ON OR OFF, STARTING THE ENGINE OR APPLYING AN EXTERNAL POWER SOURCE, THE AVIONICS MASTER SWITCH SHOULD BE TURNED OFF TO PREVENT ANY HARMFUL TRANSIENT VOLTAGE FROM DAMAGING THE AVIONICS EQUIPMENT. Normally, both sides of the master switch should be used simultaneously; however, the BAT side of the switch could be turned on separately to check equipment while on the ground.  To check or use avionics equipment or radios while on the ground, the avionics power switch must also be turned on.  The ALT side of the switch, when placed in the OFF position, removes the alternator from thel electrical system.  With this switch in the OFF position, the entire electrical load is placed on the battery.  Continued operation with the alternator switch in the OFF position will reduce battery power lowl enough to open the battery contactor, remove power from the alternator field, and prevent alternator restart. Revision 4 7-33",326.25
158,"SECTION 7 CESSNA MODEL 172S AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION AVIONICS MASTER SWITCH Electrical power for each Avionics Bus is supplied from a primary Electrical Bus. For airplane serial numbers 172S8001 through 172S8703, except for certain non-U.  S. certified airplanes, both Avionics Buses are controlled by a single-section rocker-type Avionics Master switch.  At serial number 172S8704 and on, a two- section or ""split"" rocker-type Avionics Master switch controls power to each Avionics Bus independently.  Placing the rocker in the up (ON) position provides power to the Avionics Bus. Placing the rocker in the down (OFF) position removes power from the Avionics Bus.  The Avionics Master switch is located on the lower left side of the instrument panel. NOTE For airplane serial numbers 172S8001 through 172S8703, aircraft certified outside the United States can have a two- section or ""split"" Avionics Master switch. The two-section Avionics Master switch enables independent operation of Avionics Bus 1 and Avionics Bus 2. With the Avionics Master rocker in the OFF position, no electrical power is provided to the avionics, even when the Master switch or the individual avionics component equipment switches are in their ON positions.  The Avionics Master switch (both sides, if two-section) should be placed in the OFF position before switching the Master switch ON or OFF, starting the engine, or applying an external power source.",360.0
158,"Each avionics bus also incorporates a separate circuit breaker installed between the primary bus and the avionics master switch.  In the event of an electrical malfunction, this breaker will trip and take the effected avionics bus off-line. AMMETER I The ammeter/vacuum gage is located on the lower left side of the instrument panel.  It indicates the amount of current, in amperes, from the alternator to the battery or from the battery to the airplane electrical system.  When the engine is operating and the master switch is turned on, the ammeter indicates the charging rate applied to the battery.  In the event the alternator is not functioning or the electrical load exceeds the output of the alternator, the ammeter indicates the battery discharge rate. 7-34 Revision 4",194.25
159,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 7 AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION LOW VOLTAGE ANNUNCIATION The low voltage warning annunciator is incorporated in thel annunciator panel and activates when voltage falls below 24.5 volts. If low voltage is detected, the red annunciation VOL TS will flash for approximately 10 seconds before illuminating steadily.  The pilot cannot turn off the annunciator. In the event an overvoltage condition occurs, the alternator control unit automatically opens the ALT FLO circuit breaker,I removing alternator field current and shutting off the alternator.  Thel battery will then supply system current as shown by a discharge rate on the ammeter.  Under these conditions, depending on electrical system load, the low voltage warning annunciator will illuminate when system voltage drops below normal.  The alternator control unit may be reset by resetting the circuit breaker.  If the lo~ voltage warning annunciator extinguishes, normal alternate charging has resumed; however, if the annunciator illuminate again, a malfunction has occurred, and the flight should b terminated as soon as practicable. NOTE Illumination of the low voltage annunciator and ammeter I discharge indications may occur during low RPM conditions with an electrical load on the system, such as during a low RPM taxi.  Under these conditions, the light will go out at higher RPM.",343.25
159,"CIRCUIT BREAKERS AND FUSES All circuit breakers inside the airplane are of the ""push to reset"" or ""switch/breaker"" type.  The power distribution module uses spade type (automotive style) fuses and one glass type fuse (controlling the clock). Spare fuses for the power distribution module are located inside the module.  If one of the spare fuses is used, a replacement spare should be obtained and reinstalled before the next flight. Revision 4 7-35",112.25
160,"SECTION 7 CESSNA MODEL 172S AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION !EXTERNAL POWER RECEPTACLE An external power receptacle is integral to the power distribution module and allows the use of an external electrical power source for cold weather starting, and during lengthy maintenance work on electrical and avionics equipment.  The receptacle is located on the l left side of the engine cowling, just forward of the firewall and midway up the side. Access to the receptacle is gained by removing the cover plate (earlier serial number airplanes) or opening the hinged access door (later serial number airplanes). I I I The power distribution module (J-Box) incorporates a circuit which will close the battery contactor when external power is applied through the ground service plug receptacle with the master switch turned on.  This feature is intended as a servicing aid when battery power is too low to close the contactor, and should not be used to avoid performing proper maintenance procedures on a low battery. NOTE • If no avionics equipment is to be used or serviced, the avionics master switch should be in the OFF position.  If maintenance is required on the avionics equipment, use a regulated external power source to prevent damage to the avionics equipment by transient voltage.  Do not crank or start the engine with the avionics master switch in the ON position. • Before connecting an external power source (generator type or battery cart), the avionics master switch and the master switch should be turned off.",380.0
161,"CESSNA MODEL 172S LIGHTING SYSTEMS EXTERIOR LIGHTING SECTION 7 AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION Exterior lighting consists of navigation lights on the wing tips and top of the rudder, a dual landing/taxi light configuration located in the left wing leading edge, a flashing beacon mounted on top of the vertical fin, and a strobe light on each wing tip.  In addition, two courtesy lights are recessed into the lower surface of each wing and provide illumination for each cabin door area. The exterior courtesy lights (and the rear cabin dome light) are turned on by pressing the rear cabin light switch.  Pressing the rear cabin light switch again will extinguish the three lights.  The remaining exterior lights are operated by breaker/switches located on the lower left instrument panel.  To activate these lights, place switch in the UP position.  To deactivate light, place in the DOWN position. NOTE The strobes and flashing beacon should not be used when flying through clouds or overcast; the flashing light reflected from water droplets or particles in the atmosphere, particularly at night, can produce vertigo and loss of orientation. INTERIOR LIGHTING Interior lighting is controlled by a combination of flood lighting, glareshield lighting, pedestal lighting, panel lighting, radio lighting and pilot control wheel lighting. Flood lighting is accomplished using two lights in the front and a single dome light in the rear.",358.0
161,"All flood lights are contained in the overhead console, and are turned on and off with push type switches located near each light.  The two front lights are individually rotatable, providing directional lighting for the pilot and front passenger.  The rear dome light is a fixed position light and provides for general illumination in the rear cabin area. July 8/98 7-37",92.5
162,"SECTION 7 AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION CESSNA MODEL 172S I Glareshield lighting is provided by either a fluorescent light or a series of LED lights recessed into the lower surface of the glareshield.  This light is controlled by rotating the GLARESHIELD LT dimmer, located below the nav indicators.  Rotating the dimmer clockwise increases light intensity, and rotating the dimmer counterclockwise decrease light intensity. Pedestal lighting consists of a single, hooded light located above the fuel selector.  This light is controlled by rotating the PEDESTAL LT dimmer, located below the nav indicators.  Rotating the dimmer clockwise increases light intensity, and rotating the dimmer counterclockwise decreases light intensity. Panel lighting is accomplished using individual lights mounted in each instrument and gauge.  These lights are wired in parallel and are controlled by the PANEL LT dimmer, located below the nav indicators.  Rotating the dimmer clockwise increases light intensity, and rotating the dimmer counterclockwise decreases light intensity. I Pilot control wheel lighting is accomplished by use of a rheostat and light assembly, located underneath the pilot control wheel.",299.25
162,"The light provides downward illumination from the bottom of the control wheel to the pilot's lap area.  To operate the light, first turn on the NAV light switch, then adjust the map light intensity with the knurled rheostat knob.  Rotating the dimmer clockwise increases light intensity, and rotating the dimmer counterclockwise decreases light intensity. In addition to the RADIO LT dimmer, lighting intensity for the avionics displays and the NAV indicators (pilot's panel) is controlled by the annunciator panel test switch.  When the switch is in the BRT position (earlier serial number airplanes) or the DAY position (later serial number airplanes), this lighting may be off regardless of the RADIO LT dimmer position. Regardless of the light system in question, the most probable cause of a light failure is a burned out bulb.  However, in the event any of the lighting systems fail to illuminate when turned on, check the appropriate circuit breaker.  If the circuit breaker has opened, and there is no obvious indication of a short circuit (smoke or odor), turn off the light switch of the affected light, reset the breaker, and turn the switch on again.  If the breaker opens again, do not reset it. 7-38 Revision 4",306.0
163,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 7 AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION CABIN HEATING, VENTILATING AND DEFROSTING SYSTEM The temperature and volume of airflow into the cabin can be regulated by manipulation of the push-pull CABIN HT and CABIN AIR controls (Refer to Figure 7-8).  Both controls are the double- button locking type and permit intermediate settings. For cabin ventilation, pull the CABIN AIR knob out.  To raise the air temperature, pull the CABIN HT knob out approximately 1 /4 to 1/2 inch for a small amount of cabin heat.  Additional heat is available by pulling the knob out farther; maximum heat is available with the CABIN HT knob pulled out and the CABIN AIR knob pushed full in.  When no heat is desired in the cabin, the CABIN HT knob is pushed full in. Front cabin heat and ventilating air is supplied by outlet holes spaced across a cabin manifold just forward of the pilot's and copilot's feet.  Rear cabin heat and air is supplied by two ducts from the manifold, one extending down each side of the cabin to an outlet just aft of the rudder pedals at floor level.

165,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 7 AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION PITOT-STATIC SYSTEM AND INSTRUMENTS The pitot-static system supplies ram air pressure to the airspeed indicator and static pressure to the airspeed indicator, vertical speed indicator and altimeter.  The system is composed of a heated pitot tube mounted on the lower surface of the left wing, an external static port on the lower left side of the forward fuselage, and the associated plumbing necessary to connect the instruments to the sources. The heated pitot system consists of a heating element in the pitot tube, a 5-amp switch/breaker labeled PITOT HEAT, and associated wiring.  The switch/breaker is located on the lower left side of the instrument panel.  When the pitot heat switch is turned on, the element in the pitot tube is heated electrically to maintain proper operation in possible icing conditions. A static pressure alternate source valve is installed below the throttle, and can be used if the external static source is malfunctioning.  This valve supplies static pressure from inside the cabin instead of the external static port. If erroneous instrument readings are suspected due to water or ice in the pressure line going to the standard external static pressure source, the alternate static source valve should be pulled on. Pressures within the cabin will vary with open heater/vents and windows.  Refer to Section 5 for the effect of varying cabin pressures on airspeed readings.",366.5
166,"SECTION 7 AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION AIRSPEED INDICATOR CESSNA MODEL 172S The airspeed indicator is calibrated in knots.  It incorporates a true airspeed window which allows true airspeed to be read off the face of the dial.  In addition, the indicator incorporates a window at the twelve o'clock position which displays pressure altitude overlayed with a temperature scale. Limitation and range markings (in KIAS) include the white arc (40 to 85 knots), green arc (48 to 129 knots), yellow arc (129 to 163 knots), and a red line (163 knots). To find true airspeed, first determine pressure altitude and outside air temperature.  Using this data, rotate the lower left knob until pressure altitude aligns with outside air temperature in the twelve o'clock window.  True airspeed (corrected for pressure and temperature) can now be read in the lower window. VERTICAL SPEED INDICATOR The vertical speed indicator depicts airplane rate of climb or descent in feet per minute.  The pointer is actuated by atmospheric pressure changes resulting from changes of altitude as supplied by the static source. 7-42 July 8/98",279.25
167,"CESSNA MODEL 172S ALTIMETER SECTION 7 AIRPLANE & SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION Airplane altitude is depicted by a barometric type altimeter.  A knob near the lower left portion of the indicator provides adjustment of the instrument's barometric scale to the current altimeter setting. VACUUM SYSTEM AND INSTRUMENTS The vacuum system (Refer to Figure 7-9) provides suctionl necessary to operate the attitude indicator and the directional indicator.  The system consists of two engine-driven vacuum pumps, two pressure switches for measuring vacuum available through each pump, a vacuum relief valve, a vacuum system air filter, vacuum operated instruments, a vacuum gauge, low vacuum warning on the annunciator, and a manifold with check valves to allow for normal vacuum system operation if one of the vacuum pumps should fail. ATTITUDE INDICATOR The attitude indicator is a vacuum air-driven gyro that gives a visual indication of flight attitude.  Bank attitude is presented by a pointer at the top of the indicator relative to the bank scale which has index marks at 10°, 20°, 30°, 60°, and 90° either side of the center mark.  Pitch and roll attitudes are presented by a miniature airplane superimposed over a symbolic horizon area divided into two sections by a white horizon bar.  The upper ""blue sky"" area and the lower ""ground"" area have pitch reference lines useful for pitch attitude control.  A knob at the bottom of the instrument is provided for in-flight adjustment of the symbolic airplane to the horizon bar for a more accurate flight attitude indication. DIRECTIONAL INDICATOR A directional indicator is a vacuum air-driven gyro that displays airplane heading on a compass card in relation to a fixed simulated airplane image and index.",435.75

STALL WARNING SYSTEM The airplane is equipped with a pneumatic type stall warning system consisting of an inlet in the leading edge of the left wing, an lair-operated horn near the upper left corner of the windshield, and associated plumbing.  As the airplane approaches a stall, the low pressure on the upper surface of the wings moves forward around the leading edge of the wings.  This low pressure creates a differential pressure in the stall warning system which draws air through the warning horn, resulting in an audible warning at 5 to 10 knots above stall in all flight conditions.

Avoid covering opening on back side of microphone for optimum noise canceling. STATIC DISCHARGERS Static wicks (static dischargers) are installed at various points throughout the airframe to reduce interference from precipitation static.  Under some severe static conditions, loss of radio signals is possible even with static dischargers installed.  Whenever possible, avoid known severe precipitation areas to prevent loss of dependable radio signals. If avoidance is impractical, minimize airspeed and anticipate temporary loss of radio signals while in these areas. Static dischargers lose their effectiveness with age, and therefore, should be checked periodically (at least at every annual inspection) by qualified avionics technicians, etc. 7-48 July 8/98",252.75

177,"CESSNA MODEL 172S INTRODUCTION SECTION 8 HANDLING, SERVICE & MAINTENANCE This section contains factory recommended procedures for proper ground handling and routine care and servicing of your airplane.  It also identifies certain inspection and maintenancd requirements which must be followed if your airplane is to retain that new airplane performance and dependability.  It is important to follow a planned schedule of lubrication and preventive maintenance based on climatic and flying conditions encountered in your local area. Keep in touch with your local Cessna Service Station and takel advantage of their knowledge and experience.  Your Cessna Service Station knows your airplane and how to maintain it, and will remind you when lubrications and oil changes are necessary, as well as other seasonal and periodic services. The airplane should be regularly inspected and maintained in accordance with information found in the airplane maintenance manual and in company issued service bulletins and service newsletters.  All service bulletins pertaining to the aircraft by serial number should be accomplished and the airplane should receive repetitive and required inspections. Cessna does not condone modifications, whether by Supplemental Type Certificate or otherwise, unless these certificates are held and/or approved by Cessna. Other modifications may void warranties on the airplane since Cessna has no way of knowing the full effect on the overall airplane.  Operation of an airplane that has been modified may be a risk to the occupants, and operating procedures and performance data set forth in the operating handbook may no longer be considered accurate for the modified airplane.",424.75

181,"Most of the items listed are required by the United States Federal Aviation Regulations.  Since the Regulations of other nations may require other documents and data, owners of airplanes not registered in the United States should check with their own aviation officials to determine their individual requirements. Cessna recommends that these items, plus the Pilot's Checklists, Customer Care Program Handbook and Customer Care Card, be carried in the airplane at all times. AIRPLANE INSPECTION PERIODS FAA REQUIRED INSPECTIONS As required by U.  S. Federal Aviation Regulations, all civil aircraft of U.  S. registry must undergo a complete inspection (annual) each twelve calendar months. In addition to the required annual inspection, aircraft operated commercially (for hire) must have a complete inspection every 100 hours of operation. The FAA may require other inspections by the issuance of airworthiness directives applicable to the airplane, engine, propeller and components.  It is the responsibility of the owner/operator to ensure compliance with all applicable airworthiness directives, and when the inspections are repetitive, to take appropriate steps tol prevent inadvertent noncompliance.

182,"SECTION 8 HANDLING, SERVICE & MAINTENANCE CESSNA INSPECTION PROGRAMS CESSNA MODEL 172S In lieu of the 100 hour and annual inspection requirements, an • airplane may be inspected in accordance with a Progressive Care Inspection Program or a PhaseCard Inspection Program.  Both programs offer systems which allow the work load to be divided into smaller operations that can be accomplished in shorter time periods. I The Cessna Progressive Care Inspection Program allows an airplane to be inspected and maintained in four operations.  The four operations are recycled each 200 hours and are recorded in a specially provided Aircraft Inspection Log as each operation is conducted. I The PhaseCard Inspection Program offers a parallel system for high-utilization flight operations (approximately 600 flight hours per year).  This system utilizes 50 hour intervals (Phase 1 and Phase 2) to inspect high-usage systems and components.  At 12 months or 600 flight hours, whichever occurs first, the airplane undergoes a complete (Phase 3) inspection. Regardless of the inspection method selected, the owner should keep in mind that FAR Part 43 and FAR Part 91 establishes the requirement that properly certified agencies or personnel accomplish all required FAA inspections and most of the manufacturer recommended inspections. 8-8 May 30/00",333.25
183,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 8 HANDLING, SERVICE & MAINTENANCE CESSNA CUSTOMER CARE PROGRAM Specific benefits and provisions of the Cessna Warranty plus other important benefits for you are contained in your Customer Care Program Handbook supplied with your airplane.  The Customerl Care Program Handbook should be thoroughly reviewed and kept in the airplane at all times. You will also want to return to your Cessna Service Station either at 50 hours for your first Progressive Care Operation, or at 100 hours for your first 100 hour inspection depending on which program you choose to establish for your airplane.  While these important inspections will be performed for you by any Cessna Service Station, in most cases you will prefer to have the Cessna Service Station from whom you purchased the airplane accomplish this work. PILOT CONDUCTED PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE A certified pilot who owns or operates an airplane not used as an air carrier is authorized by FAR Part 43 to perform limited maintenance on his airplane.  Refer to FAR Part 43 for a list of the specific maintenance operations which are allowed. NOTE Pilots operating airplanes of other than U.  S. registry should refer to the regulations of the country of certification for information on preventive maintenance that may be performed by pilots. May 30/00 8-9",332.25
184,"SECTION 8 HANDLING, SERVICE & MAINTENANCE CESSNA MODEL 172S A Maintenance Manual must be obtained prior to performing any preventive maintenance to ensure that proper procedures are lfollowed.  Your local Cessna Service Station should be contacted for further information or for required maintenance which must be accomplished by appropriately licensed personnel. ALTERATIONS OR REPAIRS It is essential that the FAA be contacted prior to any alterations on the airplane to ensure that airworthiness of the airplane is not violated.  Alterations or repairs to the airplane must be accomplished by licensed personnel, utilizing only FAA Approved components and FAA Approved data, such as Cessna Service Bulletins. GROUND HANDLING TOWING The airplane is most easily and safely maneuvered by hand with the tow bar attached to the nose wheel (the tow bar is stowed on the side of the baggage area).  When towing with a vehicle, do not • exceed the nose gear turning angle of 30° either side of center, or damage to the nose landing gear will result. AcAUTION REMOVE ANY INSTALLED RUDDER LOCK BEFORE TOWING. If the airplane is towed or pushed over a rough surface during hangaring, watch that the normal cushioning action of the nose strut does not cause excessive vertical movement of the tail and the resulting contact with low hangar doors or structure.  A flat nose tire or deflated strut will also increase tail height. 8-10 May 30/00",358.25
185,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 8 HANDLING, SERVICE & MAINTENANCE PARKING When parking the airplane, head into the wind and set the parking brake.  Do not set the parking brake during cold weatherl when accumulated moisture may freeze the brakes, or when the brakes are overheated.  Install the control wheel lock and chock the wheels.  In severe weather and high wind conditions, tie the airplane down as outlined in the following paragraph. TIE-DOWN Proper tie-down procedure is the best precaution against damage to the parked airplane by gusty or strong winds.  To tie-down the airplane securely, proceed as follows: 1.  Set the parking brake and install the control wheel lock. 2.  Install a surface control lock over the fin and rudder. 3.",184.75

JACKING When a requirement exists to jack the entire airplane off the ground, or when wing jack points are used in the jacking operation, refer to the Maintenance Manual for specific procedures and equipment required. Individual main gear may be jacked by using the jack pad which is incorporated in the main landing gear strut step bracket.  When using the individual gear strut jack pad, flexibility of the gear strut will cause the main wheel to slide inboard as the wheel is raised, tilting the jack.  The jack must then be lowered for a second jacking operation.  Do not jack both main wheels simultaneously using the individual main gear jack pads. May 30/00 8-11",216.5
186,"SECTION 8 CESSNA MODEL 172S HANDLING, SERVICE & MAINTENANCE A CAUTION DO NOT APPLY PRESSURE ON THE ELEVATOR OR HORIZONTAL STABILIZER SURFACES. WHEN PUSHING ON THE TAILCONE, ALWAYS APPLY PRESSURE AT A BULKHEAD TO AVOID BUCKLING THE SKIN. If nose gear maintenance is required, the nose wheel may be raised off the ground by pressing down on a tailcone bulkhead, just forward of the horizontal stabilizer, and allowing the tail to rest on the tail tie-down ring. To assist in raising and holding the nose wheel off the ground, ground anchors should be utilized at the tail tie down point. NOTE Ensure that the nose will be held off the ground under all conditions by means of suitable stands or supports under weight supporting bulkheads near the nose of the airplane. LEVELING Longitudinal leveling of the airplane is accomplished by placing a level on leveling screws located on the left side of the tailcone. Deflate the nose tire and/or lower or raise the nose strut to properly center the bubble in the level.  Corresponding points on both upper door sills may be used to level the airplane laterally. FLYABLE STORAGE Airplanes placed in non operational storage for a maximum of 30 days or those which receive only intermittent operational use for the first 25 hours are considered in flyable storage status.  Every seventh day during these periods, the propeller should be rotated by hand through five revolutions.",354.25

NOTE lsopropyl alcohol or diethylene glycol monomethyl ether (DiEGME) may be added to the fuel supply in quantities not to exceed 1 % (alcohol) or 0.15% (DiEGME) of total volume. Refer to Fuel Additives in later paragraphs for additional information. FUEL CAPACITY I 56.0 U.  S. Gallons Total: 28.0 U.  S. Gallons per tank. NOTE To ensure maximum fuel capacity when refueling and minimize cross feeding, the fuel selector valve should be placed in either the LEFT or RIGHT position and the airplane parked in a wings level, normal ground attitude. Refer to Figure 1-1 for a definition of normal ground attitude. Service the fuel system after each flight, and keep fuel tanks full to minimize condensation in the tanks. FUEL ADDITIVES Strict adherence to recommended preflight draining instructions as called for in Section 4 will eliminate any free water accumulations from the tank sumps.  While small amounts of water may still remain in solution in the gasoline, it will normally be consumed and go unnoticed in the operation of the engine.",302.5
191,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 8 HANDLING, SERVICE & MAINTENANCE One exception to this can be encountered when operating under the combined effect of: (1) use of certain fuels, with (2) high humidity conditions on the ground (3) followed by flight at high altitude and low temperature.  Under these unusual conditions, small amounts of water in solution can precipitate from the fuel stream and freeze in sufficient quantities to induce partial icing of the engine fuel system. While these conditions are quite rare and will not normally pose a problem to owners and operators, they do exist in certain areas of the world and consequently must be dealt with, when encountered. Therefore, to help alleviate the possibility of fuel icing occurring under these unusual conditions, it is permissible to add isopropyl alcohol or diethylene glycol monomethyl ether (DiEGME) compound to the fuel supply. The introduction of alcohol or DiEGME compound into the fuel provides two distinct effects: (1) it absorbs the dissolved water from the gasoline and (2) alcohol has a freezing temperature depressant effect. NOTE When using fuel additives, it must be remembered that the final goal is to obtain a correct fuel-to-additive ratio in the tank, and not just with fuel coming out of the refueling nozzle. For example, adding 15 gallons of correctly proportioned fuel to a tank which contains 20 gallons of untreated fuel will result in a lower-than-acceptable concentration level to the 35 gallons of fuel which now reside in the tank. Alcohol, if used, is to be blended with the fuel in a concentration of 1 % by volume.  Concentrations greater than 1 % are not recommended since they can be detrimental to fuel tank materials. The manner in which the alcohol is added to the fuel is significant because alcohol is most effective when it is completely dissolved in the fuel.",465.25
191,"To ensure proper mixing, the following is recommended: 1 . May 30/00 For best results, the alcohol should be added during the fueling operation by pouring the alcohol directly on the fuel stream issuing from the fueling nozzle. 8-171",58.25

A CONCENTRATION OF LESS THAN THAT I RECOMMENDED (0.10% BY TOTAL VOLUME MINIMUM) WILL RESULT IN INEFFECTIVE TREATMENT.  USE ONLY BLENDING EQUIPMENT THAT IS RECOMMENDED BY THE MANUFACTURER TO OBTAIN PROPER PROPORTIONING. Prolonged storage of the airplane will result in a water buildup in the fuel which ""leeches out"" the additive.",309.5
193,An indication of this is when an excessive amount of water accumulates in the fuel tank sumps.  The concentration can be checked using a differential refractometer.  It is imperative that the technical manual for the differential refractometer be followed explicitly when checking the additive concentration. May 30/00 8-19,80.75
194,"SECTION 8 HANDLING, SERVICE & MAINTENANCE FUEL CONTAMINATION CESSNA MODEL 172S Fuel contamination is usually the result of foreign material present in the fuel system, and may consist of water, rust, sand, dirt, microbes or bacterial growth.  In addition, additives that are not compatible with fuel or fuel system components can cause the fuel to become contaminated. Before each flight and after each refueling, use a clear sampler cup and drain at least a cupful of fuel from each fuel tank drain location and from the fuel strainer quick drain valve to determine if contaminants are present, and to ensure the airplane has been fueled with the proper grade of fuel. I it contamination is detected, drain all fuel drain points including the fuel reservoir and fuel selector quick drain valves and then gently rock the wings and lower the tail to the ground to move any additional contaminants to the sampling points.  Take repeated lsamples from all fuel drain points until all contamination has been removed.  If, after repeated sampling, evidence of contamination still exists, the airplane should not be flown.  Tanks should be drained and system purged by qualified maintenance personnel.  All evidence of contamination must be removed before further flight.  If the airplane has been serviced with the improper fuel grade, defuel completely and refuel with the correct grade.  Do not fly the airplane with contaminated or unapproved fuel.",361.5
194,"In addition, Owners/Operators who are not acquainted with a particular fixed base operator should be assured that the fuel supply has been checked for contamination and is properly filtered before allowing the airplane to be serviced.  Fuel tanks should be kept full between flights, provided weight and balance considerations will permit, to reduce the possibility of water condensing on the walls of partially filled tanks. To further reduce the possibility of contaminated fuel, routine maintenance of the fuel system should be performed in accordance with the airplane Maintenance Manual.  Only the proper fuel, as recommended in this handbook, should be used, and fuel additives should not be used unless approved by Cessna and the Federal Aviation Administration. 8-20 Revision 4",196.25

Do not over inflate. CLEANING AND CARE WINDSHIELD AND WINDOWS The plastic windshield and windows should be cleaned with an aircraft windshield cleaner.  Apply the cleaner sparingly with soft cloths, and rub with moderate pressure until all dirt, oil scum and bug stains are removed.  Allow the cleaner to dry, then wipe it off with soft flannel cloths. A, CAUTION NEVER USE GASOLINE, BENZENE, ALCOHOL, ACETONE, FIRE EXTINGUISHER, ANTI-ICE FLUID, LACQUER THINNER OR GLASS CLEANER TO CLEAN THE PLASTIC.  THESE MATERIALS WILL ATTACK THE PLASTIC AND MAY CAUSE IT TO CRAZE. If a windshield cleaner is not available, the plastic can be cleaned with soft cloths moistened with Stoddard solvent to remove oil and grease. May 30/00 s-21 I",302.75
196,"SECTION 8 HANDLING, SERVICE & MAINTENANCE CESSNA MODEL 172S Follow by carefully washing with a mild detergent and plenty of water.  Rinse thoroughly, then dry with a clean moist chamois.  Do not rub the plastic with a dry cloth since this builds up an electrostatic charge which attracts dust.  Waxing with a good commercial wax will finish the cleaning job.  A thin, even coat of wax, polished out by hand with clean soft flannel cloths, will fill in minor scratches and help prevent further scratching. Do not use a canvas cover on the windshield unless freezing rain or sleet is anticipated since the cover may scratch the plastic surface. PAINTED SURFACES The painted exterior surfaces of your new Cessna have a durable, long lasting finish. Generally, the painted surfaces can be kept bright by washing with water and mild soap, followed by a rinse with water and drying with cloths or a chamois.  Harsh or abrasive soaps or detergents which cause corrosion or scratches should never be used.  Remove stubborn oil and grease with a cloth moistened with Stoddard solvent.",268.75
196,"Take special care to make sure that the exterior graphics are not touched by the solvent. For complete care of exterior lgraphics refer to the Maintenance Manual. To seal any minor surface chips or scratches and protect against corrosion, the airplane should be waxed regularly with a good automotive wax applied in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.  If the airplane is operated in a seacoast or other salt water environment, it must be washed and waxed more frequently to assure adequate protection.  Special care should be taken to seal around rivet heads and skin laps, which are the areas most susceptible to corrosion.  A heavier coating of wax on the leading edges of the wings and tail and on the cowl nose cap and propeller spinner will help reduce the abrasion encountered in these areas. Reapplication of wax will generally be necessary after cleaning with soap solution or after chemical deicing operations. 8-22 Revision 4",237.25
197,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 8 HANDLING, SERVICE & MAINTENANCE When the airplane is parked outside in cold climates and it is necessary to remove ice before flight, care should be taken to protect the painted surfaces during ice removal with chemical liquids.lsopropyl alcohol will satisfactorily remove ice accumulations without damaging the paint.  However, keep the isopropyl alcohol away from the windshield and cabin windows since it will attack the plastic and may cause it to craze. PROPELLER CARE Preflight inspection of propeller blades for nicks, and wiping them occasionally with an oily cloth to clean off grass and bug stains will assure long blade life.  Small nicks on the propeller, particularly near the tips and on the leading edges, should be dressed out as soon as possible since these nicks produce stress concentrations, and if ignored, may result in cracks or failure of the propeller blade.  Never use an alkaline cleaner on the blades; remove grease and dirt with Stoddard solvent. ENGINE CARE The engine may be cleaned, using a suitable solvent, in accordance with instructions in the airplane Maintenance Manual. Most efficient cleaning is done using a spray type cleaner.  Before spray cleaning, ensure that protection is afforded for components which might be adversely affected by the solvent.  Refer to thel Maintenance Manual for proper lubrication of controls and components after engine cleaning.",356.75

198,"SECTION 8 HANDLING, SERVICE & MAINTENANCE INTERIOR CARE CESSNA MODEL 172S To remove dust and loose dirt from the upholstery and carpet, clean the interior regularly with a vacuum cleaner. Blot up any spilled liquid promptly with cleansing tissue or rags. Do not pat the spot; press the blotting material firmly and hold it for several seconds.  Continue blotting until no more liquid is taken up. Scrape off sticky materials with a dull knife, then spot clean the area. Oily spots may be cleaned with household spot removers, used sparingly.  Before using any solvent, read the instructions on the container and test it on an obscure place on the fabric to be cleaned.  Never saturate the fabric with a volatile solvent; it may damage the padding and backing materials. Soiled upholstery and carpet may be cleaned with foam type detergent, used according to the manufacturer's instructions.

221,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 9 - SUPPLEMENTS SUPPLEMENT 2 - FAA APPROVED SUPPLEMENT BENDIX/KING KT 76C TRANPONDER with BLIND ENCODER SECTION 1 GENERAL The Bendix/King Transponder (Type KT 76C), shown in Figure 1, is the airborne component of an Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS). The transponder enables the ATC ground controller to ""see"" and identify more readily the aircraft on the radarscope.  The blind encoder (SSD120-20) (also shown in Figure 1) enables the transponder to automatically report aircraft altitude to ATC. The Bendix/King Transponder system consists of a panel- mounted unit and an externally-mounted antenna.  The transponder receives interrogating pulse signals on 1030 MHz and transmits coded pulse-train reply signals on 1090 MHz. It is capable of replying to Mode A (aircraft identification) and also to Mode C (altitude reporting) interrogations on a selective reply basis on any of 4096 information code selections. When a panel-mounted SSD120-20 Blind Encoder (not part of KT 76C Transponder system) is included in the avionic configuration, the transponder can provide altitude reporting in 100-foot increments between -1000 and +20,000 feet. The KT 76C features microprocessor and LSI (Large Scale Integrated) control.  Mode and code selection are performed using the rotary knob and numeric buttons and all functions including the flight level altitude are presented on a gas discharge display. All display segments are automatically dimmed by a photocell type sensor.",378.0
222,"SECTION 9 - SUPPLEMENTS SUPPLEMENT 2 - FAA APPROVED CESSNA MODEL 172S A VFR programming sequence, described in Section 4, allows the pilot to preprogram any single code such as ""1200"" into the KT 76C.

Immediately after a forced landing where emergency assistance is required, the EL T should be utilized as follows: NOTE The EL T remote switch/annunciator system could be inoperative if damaged during a forced landing. If inoperative, the inertia ""G"" switch will activate automatically. However, to turn the EL T OFF and ON again requires manual switching of the master function selector switch which is located on the EL T unit. 1.  ENSURE ELT ACTIVATION: a. Position remote switch/annunciator to the ON position even if annunciator light is already on. b. If airplane radio is operable and can be safely used (no threat of fire or explosion), turn ON and select 121.5 MHz. If the EL T can be heard transmitting, it is working properly. c. Ensure that antenna is clear of obstructions.",283.25
245,"NOTE When the EL T is activated, a decreasing tone will be heard before the typical warbling tone begins. 2.  PRIOR TO SIGHTING RESCUE AIRCRAFT -- Conserve airplane battery.  Do not activate radio transceiver. 3.  AFTER SIGHTING RESCUE AIRCRAFT -- Position remote switch/annunciator to the RESET position and release to the AUTO position to prevent radio interference.  Attempt contact with rescue aircraft with the radio transceiver set to a frequency of 121.5 MHz. If no contact is established, return the remote switch/annunciator to the ON position immediately. 4.  FOLLOWING RESCUE -- Position remote switch/annunciator to the AUTO position, terminating emergency transmissions.",170.75
246,"SECTION 9 - SUPPLEMENTS SUPPLEMENT 4 - FAA APPROVED SECTION 4 NORMAL PROCEDURES CESSNA MODEL 172S As long as the remote switch/annunciator is in the AUTO position and the EL T master function selector switch remains in the AUTO position, the EL T automatically activates when the unit senses longitudinal inertia forces as required in TSO-C91 A. Following a lightning strike, or an exceptionally hard landing, the EL T may activate although no emergency exists. If the remote switch/annunciator illuminates, the EL T has inadvertently activated itself. Another way to check is to select 121.5 MHz on the radio transceiver and listen for an emergency tone transmission. If the remote switch/annunciator is illuminated or an emergency tone is heard, position the remote switch/annunciator in the RESET position and release to the AUTO position. The ELT must be serviced in accordance with FAR Part 91.207. INSPECTION/TEST 1.  The emergency locator transmitter should be tested every 100 hours. NOTE Test should only be conducted within the first 5 minutes of each hour. 2.  Disconnect antenna cable from EL T. 3.",277.5

The KLN 898 GPS (Global Positioning System) is a three- dimensional precision navigation system based on 24 earth orbiting satellites.  Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) is a function that every !FR-certified GPS receiver must continuously perform to assure position accuracy.  RAIM is available when 5 or more of these satellites are in view, or 4 satellites are in view and a barometrically corrected altitude input from the airplane's altimeter is made.  Annunciation is provided if there are not enough satellites in view to assure position integrity. Operational guidance for the KLN 898 GPS Navigation System is provided with the Bendix/King KLN 898 Pilot's Guide (supplied with the airplane).  This Pilot's Guide should be thoroughly studied and VFR operations conducted so that you are totally familiar with the GPS system of navigation before actually using this equipment in IFR conditions.

271,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 9 - SUPPLEMENTS SUPPLEMENT 6 - FAA APPROVED SUPPLEMENT BENDIX/KING KR 87 AUTOMATIC DIRECTION I FINDER (ADF) SECTION 1 GENERAL The Bendix/King Digital ADF is a panel-mounted, digitally tuned automatic direction finder. It is designed to provide continuous 1- kHz digital tuning in the frequency range of 200-kHz to 1799-kHz and eliminates the need for mechanical band switching. The system is comprised of a receiver, a built-in electronics timer, a bearing indicator, and a KA-44B combined loop and sense antenna. Operating controls and displays for the Bendix/King Digital ADF are shown and described in Figure 1 .  The audio system used in conjunction with this radio for speaker-phone selection is shown and described in Supplement 3 of this handbook. The Bendix/King Digital ADF can be used for position plotting and homing procedures, and for aural reception of amplitude- modulated (AM) signals. The ""flip-flop"" frequency display allows switching between pre- selected ""STANDBY"" and ""ACTIVE"" frequencies by pressing the frequency transfer button.  Both pre-selected frequencies are stored in a non-volatile memory circuit (no battery power required) and displayed in large, easy-to-read, self-dimming gas discharge numerics.  The active frequency is continuously displayed in the left window, while the right window will display either the standby frequency or the selected readout from the built-in electronic timer. The built-in electronic timer has two separate and independent timing functions.",382.5
271,"An automatic flight timer that starts whenever the unit is turned on. This timer functions up to 59 hours and 59 minutes.  An elapsed timer which will count up or down for up to 59 minutes and 59 seconds. When a preset time interval has been programmed and the countdown reaches :00, the display will flash for 15 seconds. Since both the flight timer and elapsed timer operate independently, it is possible to monitor either one without disrupting the other.  The pushbutton controls and the bearing indicators are internally lighted.  Intensity is controlled by the RADIO light dimming rheostat. May 30/00 S6-3",152.75

279,"CESSNA MODEL 172S ADF OPERATION NOTES: SECTION 9 - SUPPLEMENTS SUPPLEMENT 6 - FAA APPROVED ERRONEOUS ADF BEARING DUE TO RADIO FREQUENCY PHENOMENA: In the U.  S., the FCC, which assigns AM radio frequencies, occasionally will assign the same frequency to more than one station in an area. Certain conditions, such as Night Effect, may cause signals from such stations to overlap.  This should be taken into consideration when using AM broadcast station for navigation. Sunspots and atmospheric phenomena may occasionally distort reception so that signals from two stations on the same frequency will overlap. For this reason, it is always wise to make positive identification of the station being tuned, by switching the function selector to ANT and listening for station call letters. ELECTRICAL STORMS: In the vicinity of electrical storms, an ADF indicator pointer tends to swing from the station tuned toward the center of the storm. NIGHT EFFECT: This is a disturbance particularly strong just after sunset and just after dawn.  An ADF indicator pointer may swing erratically at these times. If possible, tune to the most powerful station at the lowest frequency.  If this is not possible, take the average of pointer oscillations to determine relative station bearing.",318.25
279,MOUNTAIN EFFECT: Radio waves reflecting from the surface of mountains may cause the pointer to fluctuate or show an erroneous bearing.  This should be taken into account when taking bearings over mountainous terrain. COASTAL REFRACTION: Radio waves may be refracted when passing from land to sea or when moving parallel to the coastline.  This also should be taken into account. July 8/98 S6-11,98.5

285,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 9 - SUPPLEMENTS SUPPLEMENT 7 - FAA APPROVED SUPPLEMENT 7 BENDIX/KING KAP 140 SINGLE AXIS AUTOPILOT SECTION 1 GENERAL The Bendix/King KAP 140 is an all-electric, single-axis (aileron control) autopilot system that provides lateral and directional control. Components are a computer, a turn coordinator, an aileron actuator, a course deviation indicator, and a directional indicator or HSI (if installed). Roll and yaw motions of the airplane are sensed by the turn coordinator gyro.  The computer computes the necessary correction and signals the actuator to move the ailerons to maintain the airplane in the commanded lateral attitude. The KAP 140 will provide wing leveler, heading hold, NAV track, and approach and backcourse lateral modes. A lockout device prevents autopilot engagement until the system has been successfully preflight tested.  Automatic preflight self-test begins with initial power application to the autopilot. The following conditions will cause the autopilot to disengage: A. Electric power failure. B. Internal autopilot system failure. C. Turn coordinator failure (flagged gyro).",283.0

Immediately grasp the control wheel and press and hold down the A/P DISC switch throughout the recovery. Manipulate the controls as required to safely maintain operation of the airplane within all of its operating limitations.  The AVIONICS MASTER switch may be used as required to remove all power from the Autopilot. With the AVIONICS MASTER switch off, all flight instruments will remain operational; however, communications, navigation, and identification equipment will be inoperative. Note that the emergency procedure for any malfunction is essentially the same: immediately grasp the control wheel and regain airplane control while pressing and the holding the A/P DISC switch down. It is important that all portions of the autopilot system are preflight tested prior to each flight in accordance with the procedures published herein in order to assure their integrity and continued safe operation during flight.",420.5

The optional KAP 140, 2 Axis Autopilot with Altitude Preselect (if installed) adds Altitude Alerter and Altitude Preselect capabilities. IThe KAP 140 2 Axis Autopilot has an electric trim system which provides autotrim during autopilot operation and manual electric trim (MET) for the pilot when the autopilot is not engaged.  The electric trim system is designed to be fail safe for any single inflight trim malfunction.  Trim faults are visually and aurally annunciated. A lockout device prevents autopilot or MET engagement until the lsystem has successfully passed preflight self-test. Automatic preflight self-test begins with initial power application to the autopilot. The following conditions will cause the autopilot to disengage: A. Electric Power failure. B. Internal Autopilot System failure. C. Pitch accelerations in excess of + 1.4g or less than +0.6g only when produced by a failure causing servo runaway.",334.75
330,The I pilot cannot maneuver the airplane and trip the monitor. D. Turn coordinator failure (small square red flag visible on instrument). E. Computer autopilot monitor that detects either the R (ROLL) or P (PITCH) axis annunciator. I S15-4 Revision 5,62.5
331,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 9 - SUPPLEMENTS SUPPLEMENT 15 - FAA APPROVED Activation of A/P DISC/TRIM INT control wheel switch will also disconnect the autopilot. The AVIONICS MASTER switch supplies power to the avionics bus bar of the radio circuit breakers and the autopilot circuit breaker. The AVIONICS MASTER switch also serves as an emergency AP/MET shutoff. The following circuit breakers are used to protect the KAP 140 2 Axis Autopilot: I LABEL AUTO PILOT WARN FUNCTIONS Pull-off circuit breaker supplies power to the KC 140 Computer and the autopilot pitch, roll and pitch trim servos. Supplies separate power for autopilot alerting (PITCH TRIM) on the airplane's annunciator panel. At 172S serial number 172S9423 and On, automated Roll Steering functionality has been added to the Bendix/King KLN 94 GPS Navigation System and the KAP 140 2 Axis Autopilot System.  Roll Steering coupling between the GPS and the Autopilot provides area navigation with automatic course changes at flight plan waypoints similar to Flight Management System (FMS) operations, but without vertical navigation capability.  The Roll Steering function is similar to ""turn anticipation"" for the autopilot. At the noted serial effectivity, the KLN 94 GPS (ORS 03 or later) has an added Roll Steering signal output.  In order for the GPS Roll Steering output to be utilized, the KAP 140 Autopilot (-7904 or later) has an added input for the Roll Steering signal and additional system wiring has been added to the airplane to connect the Roll Steering signal output from the KLN 94 GPS to the Roll Steering input of the KAP 140 Autopilot.",404.25

An autopilot or autotrim malfunction occurs when there is an uncommanded deviation in the airplane flight path or when there is abnormal control wheel or trim wheel motion.  In some cases, and especially for autopilot trim, there may be little to no airplane motion, yet the red PITCH TRIM annunciator (airplane annunciator panel) may illuminate and an alert tone may sound. The primary concern in reacting to an autopilot or autopilot trim malfunction, or to an automatic disconnect of the autopilot, is in maintaining control of the airplane.  Immediately grasp the control wheel and press and hold down the A/P DISC/TRIM INT switch throughout the recovery. Manipulate the controls as required to safely maintain operation of the airplane within all of its operating limitations. Elevator trim should be used manually as needed to relieve control forces. Locate and pull the AUTO PILOT circuit breaker on the right hand circuit breaker panel to completely disable the autopilot system. 2.",327.0

After these steps have been accomplished secure the autopilot electric trim system by pulling the autopilot (AUTO PILOT) circuit breaker. As with any other airplane emergency procedure, it is important that the 4 steps of the emergency procedure located on Page 15 be committed to memory. 4.  The AVIONICS MASTER switch may be used to remove all electric power from the Autopilot and Electric Trim systems while the circuit breaker is located and pulled. Return the AVIONICS MASTER switch to the ON position as soon as possible.  With the AVIONICS MASTER switch off, all avionics and autopilot equipment will be inoperable. 5.

At 172S Serial number 172S9423 and On, Roll Steering functionality enables the GPS navigation computer to control the autopilot and automatically perform course changes (turns) and intercept the course to the next active waypoint (when GPS is selected as the autopilot navigation source).  The GPS navigation computer uses ground speed, track, and turn rate data to calculate the required bank angle for waypoint course changes. The GPS Roll Steering output will command the autopilot to turn and intercept the course to the new active waypoint without directly overflying the immediate waypoint (except designated flyover waypoints).  Distance from the waypoint for the GPS to initiate the turn will vary with groundspeed, etc.,but will usually be within one nautical mile of the waypoint.  Sequencing to the next waypoint will occur approximately at the midpoint of the turn (transition segment).

The transponder enables the ATC ground controller to accurately identify the airplane on the radarscope. The KT 73 Transponder system consists of a transponder unit mounted in the instrument panel, an analog pressure altitude encoder, and an externally-mounted L-Band antenna. The KT 73 Transponder system installation uses the same antenna, altitude encoder and mounting hardware as the Bendix/King KT 76C Mode A/C Transponder. The KT 73 Transponder operates in Mode A (""SQUAWK 11 ), Mode C (altitude reporting), and Mode S (elementary surveillance/selective interrogation). The transponder receives interrogating signals on 1030 MHz and transmits coded reply signals on 1090 MHz. In Mode C operation, the KT 73 provides altitude information automatically to ATC ground stations. The transponder reports altitude in 100-foot increments between -1000 and +20,000 feet MSL. Mode S allows the ground station to individually interrogate the airplane by the unique 24-bit address assigned to the airplane. The KT 73 Transponder features an all solid-state transmitter with microprocessor controls.",341.0

Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) is a function that every !FR-certified GPS receiver must continuously perform to assure position accuracy.  RAIM is available when 5 or more of these satellites are in view, or 4 satellites are in view and a barometrically corrected altitude input from the airplane's altimeter is made.  Annunciation is provided if there are not enough satellites in view to assure position integrity. Operational guidance for the KLN 94 GPS Navigation System is provided with the Bendix/King KLN 94 Pilot's Guide (supplied with the airplane).  This Pilot's Guide should be thoroughly studied and VFR operations conducted so that you are totally familiar with GPS navigation before actually using this equipment in IFR conditions. At 172S serial number 172S9423 and On, automated Roll Steering functionality has been added to the Bendix/King KLN 94 GPS Navigation System and the KAP 140 2 Axis Autopilot System. Roll Steering coupling between the GPS and the Autopilot provides area navigation with automatic course changes at flight plan waypoints similar to Flight Management System (FMS) operations, but without vertical navigation capability.  The Roll Steering function is similar to ""turn anticipation"" for the autopilot.",387.75
378,"At the noted serial effectivity, the KLN 94 GPS (ORS 03 or later) has an added Roll Steering signal output.  In order for the GPS Roll Steering output to be utilized, the KAP 140 Autopilot (-7904 or later) has an added input for the Roll Steering signal and additional system wiring has been added to the airplane to connect the Roll Steering signal output from the KLN 94 GPS to the Roll Steering input of the KAP 140 Autopilot.

379,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 9 - SUPPLEMENTS SUPPLEMENT 19 - FAA APPROVED Every 28 days, Bendix/King receives new aeronautical database information from Jeppesen Sanderson for each database region. This information is processed and downloaded onto the database cards. Bendix/King makes these database card updates available to KLN 94 GPS users. The database card is an electronic memory containing information on airports, navaids, intersections, DPs, ST ARs, instrument approaches, special use airspace, and other items of interest to the pilot. AcAUTION THE DATABASE MUST BE UPDATED ONLY WHILE THE AIRPLANE IS ON THE GROUND. I THE KLN 94 DOES NOT PERFORM ANY NAVIGATION FUNCTION WHILE THE DATABASE IS BEING UPDATED. NOTE A current database is required by regulation in order to use the KLN 94 GPS system for non-precision approaches. Provided the KLN 94 navigation system is receiving adequate usable signals, it has been demonstrated capable of and has been shown to meet the accuracy specifications of: VFR/IFR enroute oceanic and remote, enroute domestic, terminal, and instrument approach (GPS, Loran-C, VOR, VOR-DME, TACAN, NOB, NDB- DME, RNAV) operation within the U.

A KLN 94 Quick Reference, P/N 006-18228- 0000, dated August 2000 (or later applicable revision) containing an approach sequence, operating tips and approach related messages is intended as well for cockpit use by the pilot familiar with KLN 94 operations when conducting instrument approaches. AUTOPILOT COUPLED OPERATION The KLN 94 may be coupled to the KAP 140 autopilot when I engaged in NAV mode by selecting GPS on the NAV/GPS switch. Manual selection of the desired course on the NO.1 OBS or HSI course pointer is required to provide course datum to the KAP 140 autopilot. (Frequent course datum changes may be necessary, such as in the case of flying a DME arc.)The autopilot approach mode (APR) should be used when conducting a coupled GPS approach. NOTE NAV or APR coupled DME arc intercepts can result in excessive overshoots (aggravated by high ground speeds and/or intercepts from inside the arc). At 172S serial number 172S9423 and On, Roll Steering functionality enables the GPS navigation computer to control the autopilot and automatically perform course changes (turns) and intercept the course to the next active waypoint (when GPS is selected as the autopilot navigation source).  The GPS navigation computer uses ground speed, track and turn rate data to calculate the required bank angle for waypoint course changes.",398.5
389,"The GPS Roll Steering output will command the autopilot to turn and intercept the course to the new active waypoint without directly overflying the immediate waypoint (except designated flyover waypoints).  Distance from the waypoint for the GPS to initiate the turn will vary with ground speed, etc.,but will usually be within one nautical mile of the waypoint.  Sequencing to the next waypoint will occur approximately at the midpoint of the turn (transition segment). Revision 4 S19-1 s I",122.75
390,"SECTION 9 - SUPPLEMENTS SUPPLEMENT 19 - FAA APPROVED CESSNA MODEL 172S I Roll Steering is the default operating mode for the autoflight system when all of the following conditions are met: 1.  The autopilot is engaged in NAV or APR mode 2.  GPS is selected as the autopilot navigation source 3.  The GPS navigation computer is executing an active flight plan 4.  The GPS is operating in LEG mode. When Roll Steering is in operation, adjusting or change in the position of the heading bug or the course pointer will have no effect on heading or course.  It is recommended that both the heading bug and the course pointer always be set to the current course to enhance situational awareness, especially in the event of unexpected autoflight equipment failure. GPS signal loss requires that the pilot immediately select an alternate autopilot navigation source.  If autopilot function is lost, the pilot is required to resume manual control of the airplane. Keeping the heading bug and course pointer set to the present course makes immediate recovery easier.",264.0

The audio amplifier powers the cockpit overhead speaker when selected. Receiver audio is selected using ten back-lit pushbutton switches.  Selected receivers can be identified by the illuminated green LED on the appropriate switch pushbutton. The rotary microphone selector switch automatically supplies the audio for the transceiver selected; The Com 1 and Com 2 switches permit the user to monitor or ""guard"" the audio from the other transceiver.  All operating controls are shown and described in Figure 1. An unamplified and unswitched stereo audio input is provided for an entertainment audio source (Walkman or similar Portable Electronic Device (PED)).  The Entertainment audio input is located on the lower half of the cockpit center pedestal; the 3.5 mm stereo jack is labeled ""AUX AUDIO IN"". The KMA 28 includes the Soft Mute feature that lowers the audio level of the entertainment signal whenever radio or intercom audio is present.  Refer to 14 CFR Part 91.21 and Advisory Circular No.",320.5

MARKER BEACON ANNUNCIATOR LIGHTS -- The three-light marker beacon receiver built into the KMA 28 gives a visual and aural signal when the ship's antenna passes over a 75 MHz beacon. The blue, amber, and white lights on the faceplate, as well as the audio tones, identify the beacon type. OUTER [OJ -- Light illuminates blue to indicate passage of outer marker beacon. MIDDLE [M] -- Light illuminates amber to indicate passage of middle marker beacon. INNER, AIRWAY and FAN [I] -- Light illuminates white to indicate passage of ILS inner, airway or fan marker beacons. 2.  MARKER BEACON SENSITIVITY & TEST/MUTE SELECT SWITCH -- The three-position switch is used to set the receiver sensitivity and to test the annunciator lamps. When this switch is on ""HI"" (upper) position, the high sensitivity is selected which permits you to hear the outer marker tone about a mile out. At this point you may select the ""LO"" (middle) position to give you a more accurate location of the Marker.",269.25
401,"When used only for approach markers, many pilots choose to leave the switch in the LO sensitivity position. The ""T/M"" (bottom) position is a momentary switch that will illuminate all three lamps simultaneously to assure they are in working order. This switch also has a Marker Beacon ""mute"" function. Pushing the switch to the T/M position while receiving a marker beacon signal will cause the audio to be temporarily silenced. No action is required to restore the audio in time for the next beacon.

When one of these buttons is pressed, it will stay in the ""in"" position until the button is pressed again and it will be put in the ""out"" position and removes that receiver from the audio. To provide additional feedback for button operation, activate the key ""click"" by pushing and holding both COM 1 and COM 2 receiver buttons for five seconds, and release. Repeat to defeat the click. 4.",262.0
402,"MICROPHONE SELECTOR SWITCH (MIC) -- Used to select the desired transmitter for the cockpit microphones. The ""COM 1 "", ""COM 2"", and ""COM 3"" positions are for transmitting on the Com 1, Com 2, and Com 3 communications transceivers, respectively.  When the mic selector switch is in the COM 1 position, both pilot and copilot will be connected to the COM 1 transceiver.  Only the person who presses their Push-to-Talk (PTT) switch, will be heard over the aircraft radio. Turning the rotary switch to the COM 2 position will place pilot and copilot on COM 2.  The KMA 28 gives priority to the pilot's PTT.  If the copilot is transmitting, and the pilot presses his PTT, the pilot's microphone will be heard over the selected COM transmitter.  Turning the mic selector counterclockwise to COM 3 places both the pilot and copilot on COM 3.  Com 3 receiver audio is automatically placed in the headset (and speaker if selected).  COM 1 and/or COM 2 receiver audio can be selected to monitor those transceivers.",250.75
402,"Audio from the selected transceiver is automatically heard in the headsets.  This function can be checked by switching from COM 1 to COM 2 and watching the selected audio light on the selector change from COM 1 to COM 2.  This ensures the pilot will always hear the audio from the transceiver he is transmitting on. When transmitting, the COM 1 or COM 2 LED audio selector will blink as a further indication of the selected transmitter. When switching the mic selector switch from COM 1 to COM 2, if the COM 1 audio has been selected, COM 1 audio will continue to be heard.  When switching from COM 1 to COM 2 if COM 1 has NOT been selected, COM 1 audio will be switched off. Figure 1.  Bendix/King KMA 28 Audio Selector Panel (Sheet 2 of 5) S20-6 Dec 30/00",189.25

451,"CESSNA MODEL 172S SECTION 9 - SUPPLEMENTS SUPPLEMENT 26 - FAA APPROVED SUPPLEMENT BENDIX/KING KOR 510 FLIGHT INFORMATION SERVICES (FIS) SECTION 1 GENERAL The Bendix/King KOR 510 Flight Information Services (FIS) installation provides weather information and other flight advisory information to pilots to enhance situational awareness.  The services rely on a network of ground based VHF transmitters that continuously broadcast data to any aircraft within line-of-sight of the transmitter. The aircraft must be equipped with a dedicated VHF antenna and receiver for FIS. Data is then presented to the pilot using the KMD 550 multi-function display. FIS information is intended to be used as a strategic planning tool to help the pilot avoid inclement weather areas that are beyond his visual range. FIS lacks the sufficient resolution and update rate necessary for severe weather penetration. NOTE Cessna Aircraft Company does not guarantee the quality, accuracy, or availability of FIS data.  Some data is available to all KOR 51 O installations while other data is available only by subscription. The network of transmitters may not cover the entire area where the aircraft is operated, and the aircraft may need to be above 5000 feet AGL to receive FIS data in areas where coverage does exist. SECTION 2 LIMITATIONS Use of the Bendix/King KOR 51 O Flight Information Services (FIS) for severe weather penetration is prohibited.",357.75
452,SECTION 9 - SUPPLEMENTS SUPPLEMENT 26 - FAA APPROVED SECTION 3 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES CESSNA MODEL 172S No additional emergency procedures are required when the KOR 51 O Flight Information Services (FIS) equipment is installed in the airplane. SECTION 4 NORMAL PROCEDURES Press the WX function select key of the KMD 550 multi-function display to toggle through weather related systems installed on the aircraft that display on the KMD 550. The MODE button toggles between different weather related information displays such as switching between METARs and PIREPs.  It is highly recommended that the pilot read the Bendix/King subscription agreement and the FIS addendum to the KMD 550/850 Pilot's Guide to understand the entire range of information available. It is possible that data availability and subscription services may change over time.

An unbuckled restraint airbag will not inflate. SECTION2 LIMITATIONS A child safety seat shall not be used with the V23 AAIR System in the front seat (co-pilot).  A child safety seat may be used in the rear seat positions only by attaching the child seat with an auxiliary child seat buckle.  The standard inflatable restraint buckle cannot be used to secure a child safety seat. The Auxiliary Child Seat Buckle adapter secures a Child Safety Seat to either left or right positions of the Rear Seat for all models and the Middle Seats for Model 206 (see warning label below).  For the Rear Seats, it is typically stored under the cushion and is found in the center of the seat adjacent to the standard AAIR End- Release Buckle Assembly.  For the Middle Seats of Model 206, it is attached at the same attachment point as the metal strap AAIR End-release Buckle Assy and may be stored under the seat cushion.  Both these Child Seat Buckle adapters are identifiable by part number below and attach to the Airbag Belt portion of the Seatbelt Airbag Assembly (see diagram).",388.75
